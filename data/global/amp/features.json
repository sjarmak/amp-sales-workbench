No model selector, always the best models. You don’t pick models, we do. Instead of offering selectors and checkboxes and building for the lowest common denominator, Amp is built to use the full capabilities of the best models. 3. We assume that you want to access the raw power these models have to offer. In a sense, when you’re using Amp, you aren’t using Amp — you’re talking directly to a model and Amp is the shell around your conversation with the model. 4. Built to evolve. Products that lock themselves into specific model behaviors become obsolete in months. We stay current with the best, not tied to the past.",

      "sectionId": "how-to-prompt",
      "description": "Amp currently uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 for most tasks, with up to 1 million tokens of context. For the best results, follow these guidelines: • Be explicit with what you want. Instead of “can you do X?”, try “do X.” • Keep it short, keep it focused. Break very large tasks up into smaller sub-tasks, one per thread. Do not ask the agent to write database migrations in the same thread as it previously changed CSS for a documentation page. • Don’t try to make the model guess. If you know something about how to achieve what you want the agent to do — which files to look at, which commands to run — put it in your prompt. • If you want the model to not write any code, but only to research and plan, say so: “Only plan how to implement this. Do NOT write any code.” • Use AGENTS.md files to guide Amp on how to run your tests and build steps and to avoid common mistakes. • Abandon threads if they accumulated too much noise. Sometimes things go wrong and failed attempts with error messages clutter up the context window. In those cases, it’s often best to start with a new thread and a clean context window. • Tell the agent how to best review its work: what command or test to run, what URL to open, which logs to read. Feedback helps agents as much as it helps us. The first prompt in the thread carries a lot of weight. It sets the direction for the rest of the conversation. We encourage you to be deliberate with it. That’s why we use Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to submit a message in Amp — it’s a reminder to put effort into a prompt. Here are some examples of prompts we’ve used with Amp: • “Make observeThreadGuidanceFiles return Omit<ResolvedGuidanceFile, 'content'>] and remove that field from its return value, and update the tests. Note that it is omitted because this is used in places that do not need the file contents, and this saves on data transferred over the view API.” ([See Thread) • “Run <build command> and fix all the errors” • “Look at <local development server url> to see this UI component. Then change it so that it looks more minimal. Frequently check your work by screenshotting the URL” • “Run git blame on the file I have open and figure out who added that new title” • “Convert these 5 files to use Tailwind, use one subagent per file” • “Take a look at git diff — someone helped me build a debug tool to edit a Thread directly in JSON. Please analyze the code and see how it works and how it can be improved. \\…\\]” ([See Thread) • “Check git diff --staged and remove the debug statements someone added” (See Thread) • “Find the commit that added this using git log, look at the whole commit, then help me change this feature” • “Explain the relationship between class AutoScroller and ViewUpdater using a diagram” • “Run psql and rewire all the threads in the databaser to my user (email starts with thorsten)” (See Thread) Also see Thorsten Ball’s How I Use Amp. If you’re in a workspace, use Amp’s thread sharing to learn from each other.",

      "description": "Amp looks in AGENTS.md files for guidance on codebase structure, build/test commands, and conventions. File Examples AGENTS.md in cwd, parent dirs, & subtrees Architecture, build/test commands, overview of internal APIs, review and release steps $HOME/.config/amp/AGENTS.md $HOME/.config/AGENTS.md Personal preferences, device-specific commands, and guidance that you're testing locally before committing to your repository Amp includes AGENTS.md files automatically: • AGENTS.md files in the current working directory (or editor workspace roots) _and_ parent directories (up to $HOME) are always included. • Subtree AGENTS.md files are included when the agent reads a file in the subtree. • Both $HOME/.config/amp/AGENTS.md and $HOME/.config/AGENTS.md are included if they exist. If a file named AGENT.md (without an S) exists in any of those locations, and no AGENTS.md exists, the AGENT.md file will be used for backward compatibility. In a large repository with multiple subprojects, we recommend keeping the top-level AGENTS.md general and creating more specific AGENTS.md files in subtrees for each subproject. To see the agent files that Amp is using, run /agent-files (CLI) or hover the X% of 968k indicator after you’ve sent the first message in a thread (editor extension). Amp offers to generate an AGENTS.md file for you if none exists. You can create or update any AGENTS.md files manually or by asking Amp (_“Update AGENTS.md based on what I told you in this thread”_). To include other files as context, @-mention them in agent files. For example: See @doc/style.md and @specs/**/*.md. When making commits, see @doc/git-commit-instructions.md. • Relative paths are interpreted relative to the agent file containing the mention. • Absolute paths and @~/some/path are also supported. • @-mentions in code blocks are ignored, to avoid false positives. • Glob patterns are supported (such as @doc/*.md or @.agent/**/*.md). To provide guidance that only applies when working with certain files, you can specify globs in YAML front matter of mentioned files. For example, to apply language-specific coding rules: 1. Put See @docs/*.md anywhere in your AGENTS.md file. 2. Create a file docs/typescript-conventions.md with: `--- globs: - '/*.ts' - '/*.tsx' --- Follow these TypeScript conventions: - Never use the any type - ...` 3. Repeat for other languages. Mentioned files with globs will only be included if Amp has read a file matching any of the globs (in the example above, any TypeScript file). If no globs are specified, the file is always included when @-mentioned. Globs are implicitly prefixed with **/ unless they start with ../ or ./, in which case they refer to paths relative to the mentioned file. Other examples: • Frontend-specific guidance: globs: [\"src/components/\", \"/*.tsx\"] • Backend guidance: globs: [\"server/\", \"api/\"] • Test guidance: globs: [\"*.test.ts\", \"__tests__/*\"] • From Claude Code: mv CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md && ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md, and repeat for subtree CLAUDE.md files • From Cursor: mv .cursorrules AGENTS.md && ln -s AGENTS.md .cursorrules and then add @.cursor/rules/*.mdc anywhere in AGENTS.md to include all Cursor rules files. • From existing AGENT.md: mv AGENT.md AGENTS.md (optional - both filenames continue to work)",

      "description": "After installing and logging in, run amp to start the Amp CLI. Without any arguments, it runs in interactive mode: $ amp If you pipe input to the CLI, it uses the input as the first user message in interactive mode: $ echo \"commit all my changes\" | amp Use -x or --execute to start the CLI in execute mode (not available in Amp Free). In this mode, it sends the message provided to -x to the agent, waits until the agent ended its turn, prints its final message, and exits: $ amp -x \"what files in this folder are markdown files? Print only the filenames.\" README.md AGENTS.md You can also pipe input when using -x: $ echo \"what package manager is used here?\" | amp -x cargo If you want to use -x with the agent using tools that might require approval, make sure to either use --dangerously-allow-all or configure Amp to allow them: `$ amp --dangerously-allow-all -x \"Run sed to replace 2024 with 2025 in README.\" Done. Replaced 8 occurrences of 2024 in README.md` Execute mode is automatically turned on when you redirect stdout: $ echo \"what is 2+2?\" | amp > response.txt When you pipe input and provide a prompt with -x, the agent can see both: $ cat ~/.vimrc | amp -x \"which colorscheme is used?\" The colorscheme used is gruvbox with dark background and hard contrast. `vim set background=dark let g:gruvbox_contrast_dark = \"hard\" colorscheme gruvbox ` You can use the --mcp-config flag with -x commands to specify an MCP server without modifying your configuration file. $ amp --mcp-config '{\"everything\": {\"command\": \"npx\", \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything\"]}}' -x \"What tools are available to you?\" To see more of what the CLI can do, run amp --help. The Amp CLI supports slash commands. Type / followed by the name of a command to execute it. • /help - Show help and hotkeys • /new - Start a new thread • /continue - Continue an existing thread • /queue [message] - Queue a message to send when inference completes • /dequeue - Dequeue all messages and restore them to the prompt editor • /generate-agent-file - Generate an AGENTS.md file in the current workspace • /agent-files - List AGENTS.md guidance files in use for the current thread • /compact - Compact the thread to reduce context usage • /editor - Open your $EDITOR to write a prompt • /permissions - Edit permission rules in $EDITOR • /quit - Exit Amp You can also create your own, custom slash commands. They allow you to reuse prompts or dynamically generate them. To create a custom slash command, create a Markdown file or an executable in one of the following locations: • .agents/commands in the current workspace • ~/.config/amp/commands (uses the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory if set) Each file in these directories, if it’s a Markdown file ending in .md or an executable file (having the execute bit set or a shebang on the first line)), will be turned into a slash command. The name of the slash command will be the filename without the extension. Custom slash commands based on Markdown files will, when invoked, insert the contents of the file into the prompt input. Custom slash commands based on executable files will execute the file and the combined stdout/stderr output of the file (max 50k characters) will be sent as a user message. Slash commands based on executables can also take arguments which will then be passed to the executable when it’s invoked. Here are two examples: • The file .agents/commands/pr-review.md will be turned into the slash command /pr-review and the contents of pr-review.md will be inserted into the prompt input. • ~/.config/amp/commands/outline is an executable that will be turned into the slash command /outline and can be used with arguments: /outline src/utils And here are real-world examples that you can take a closer look at: • work-on-linear-issue • resolve-pr-comments • code-review.md Execute shell commands directly in the CLI by starting your message with $. The command and its output will be included in the context window for the next message to the agent. Use $$ to activate incognito shell mode, where commands execute but aren’t included in the context. This is useful for noisy commands or quick checks you’d normally run in a separate terminal. In modern terminal emulators, such as Ghostty, Wezterm, Kitty, or iTerm2, you can use shift-enter to insert a newline in your prompts. Additionally you can also use type \\ followed by return to insert a newline. If you have the environment variable $EDITOR set, you can use the /editor slash command to open your editor to write a prompt. Amp’s CLI supports streaming JSON output format, one object per line on stdout, for programmatic integration and real-time conversation monitoring. Use the --stream-json flag with --execute mode to output in stream JSON format instead of plain text. Basic usage with argument: $ amp --execute \"what is 3 + 5?\" --stream-json Combining —stream-json with amp threads continue: $ amp threads continue --execute \"now add 8 to that\" --stream-json With stdin input: $ echo \"analyze this code\" | amp --execute --stream-json You can find the schema for the JSON output in the Appendix. Input can be also be provided on stdin with the --stream-json-input flag: $ echo '{ \"type\": \"user\", \"message\": { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"what is 2+2?\" } ] } }' | amp -x --stream-json --stream-json-input The --stream-json flag requires --execute mode. It cannot be used standalone. And --stream-json-input requires --stream-json. When using --stream-json-input, the behavior of --execute changes in that Amp will only exit once both the assistant is done _and_ stdin has been closed. This allows for programmatic use of the Amp CLI to have conversations with multiple user messages. See the Appendix for the schema of the output, example output, and more usage examples.",

Configuration options for local MCP servers: • command - executable • args - command arguments (optional) • env - environment variables (optional) Configuration options for remote (HTTP/SSE) MCP servers: • url - server endpoint • headers - HTTP headers to send with requests (optional) Amp automatically detects the appropriate transport type (HTTP or SSE) based on the server’s response headers. If the remote MCP server requires authorization with OAuth, you can use either use mcp-remote or pass authentication headers directly via the headers option. Example configuration: \"amp.mcpServers\": { \"playwright\": { \"command\": \"npx\", \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\", \"--headless\", \"--isolated\"] }, \"semgrep\": { \"url\": \"https://mcp.semgrep.ai/mcp\" }, \"sourcegraph\": { \"url\": \"https://sourcegraph.example.com/.api/mcp/v1\", \"headers\": { \"Authorization\": \"token sgp_your-token-here\" } }, \"linear\": { \"command\": \"npx\", \"args\": [ \"mcp-remote\", \"https://mcp.linear.app/sse\" ] }, \"monday\": { \"url\": \"https://mcp.monday.com/sse\", \"headers\": { \"Authorization\": \"Bearer your-token-here\" } } } You can also add MCP servers using the CLI with header options: $ amp mcp add sourcegraph --header \"Authorization=token sgp_your-token-here\" https://sourcegraph.example.com/.api/mcp/v1 Too many available tools can reduce model performance, so for best results, be selective: • Use MCP servers that expose a small number of high-level tools with high-quality descriptions. • Disable MCP tools that you aren’t using, by hovering over a tool name in the extension’s Settings interface and clicking so it’s shown as tool\\_name, or by adding them to amp.tools.disable in your configuration file. • Consider using CLI tools instead of MCP servers.

This model is available to Amp’s main agent through a tool called oracle, and it currently uses GPT-5. The main agent can autonomously decide to ask the oracle for help when debugging or reviewing a complex piece of code. We intentionally do not force the main agent to _always_ use the oracle, due to higher costs and slower inference speed. We recommend explicitly asking Amp’s main agent to use the oracle when you think it will be helpful. Here are some examples from our own usage of Amp: • “Use the oracle to review the last commit’s changes. I want to make sure that the actual logic for when an idle or requires-user-input notification sound plays has not changed.” • “Ask the oracle whether there isn’t a better solution.” • “I have a bug in these files: … It shows up when I run this command: … Help me fix this bug. Use the oracle as much as possible, since it’s smart.” • “Analyze how the functions foobar and barfoo are used. Then I want you to work a lot with the oracle to figure out how we can refactor the duplication between them while keeping changes backwards compatible.”",

The Librarian’s answers are typically longer and more detailed as we built it to provide in-depth explanations. The Librarian will only search code on the default branch of the repository. You need to configure a connection to GitHub in your settings to use it. If you want the Librarian to be able to see your private repositories, you need to select them when configuring your GitHub connection. You might need to prompt the main agent explicitly to use the Librarian. Here are some examples: • “Explain how new versions of our documentation are deployed when we release. Search our docs and infra repositories to see how they get to X.Y.sourcegraph.com.” • “I have a bug in this validation code using Zod, it’s throwing a weird error.

      "description": "We shipped several changes to toolboxes that make them easier to use: • You can now have multiple toolboxes in the AMP_TOOLBOX environment variable • amp tools make is a new command to create a functional example tool in the right location • amp tools show lets you inspect a tool • amp tools use allows you to execute it And Amp itself can fill in all the details to make the tool work as you intended. If you don't yet know what toolboxes are: a toolbox is a directory full of UNIX-style programs that provide custom tools to the agent locally. Conceptually, they sit between MCP servers and common CLI tools, but are less complex than MCP servers and easier for the agent to use than plain CLI tools. Let's use an example to see how we can use amp tools make and amp tools use to create and run a new tool in a new toolbox. Let's build a run_tests tool. Chances are that if you have used any coding agent before, you've probably seen it trying to run the your tests, but then stumble and having to guess a few times what the correct command invocation is. We can make (artificial) life for the agent easier by giving it a run_tests tool that will always use the correct command. First we create a .amp/tools directory in our repository and add it to the AMP_TOOLBOX variable, so Amp knows to look there for tools: `bash mkdir -p .amp/tools export AMP_TOOLBOX=\"$PWD/.amp/tools:$HOME/.config/amp/tools\" ` Next we run amp tools make to create a new tool, using a built-in template: `bash amp tools make run_tests ` Which prints: ` Tool created at: /Users/dhamidi/w/amp-wip/.amp/tools/run_tests Inspect with: amp tools show tb__run_tests Execute with: amp tools use tb__run_tests ` Great! Now we could open .amp/tools/run_tests manually and edit it as needed, so it actually does what we want and runs the tests. But, hey, we can also tell Amp to inspect our package.json file, find the right test command, and adjust the tool template accordingly: `bash amp --dangerously-allow-all -x 'Edit .amp/tools/run_tests to run the tests using pnpm test according to our package.json file. It should have an optional workspace parameter and an optional parameter for filtering by test name' ` Now we can use amp tools show to inspect the tool and see what Amp has created: ` amp tools show tb__run_tests ` That prints the description of the tool (which the Amp agent will see) and the schema of the input parameters (which the agent will use to run the tool): ` You must use this tool to run tests instead of using the Bash tool. This tool runs tests using pnpm test with optional workspace filtering and test name filtering. • workspace (string): optional workspace name to run tests in (e.g., \"core\", \"web\", \"server\", \"cli\"). If not provided, runs tests in the root workspace • testName (string): optional test name filter to run specific tests (passed as -t argument to vitest) ` But before we now have the agent try it, we can use amp tools use to execute the tool to make sure it works: ` amp tools use --only output tb__run_tests --testName \"writes a tool\" ` Note how we specified --testName, one of the input parameters of the tool. If we run the command, we'll see something like this: ` Test Files 1 passed | 306 skipped (307) Tests 1 passed | 4181 skipped (4182) ` It works! And now, when you start Amp, it will automatically register this tool at startup, and use it to run the tests: 2. October 21, 2025",

It allows Amp to search all public code on GitHub as well as your private GitHub repositories. Tell Amp to summon the Librarian when you need to find code in multiple repositories, or, for example, when you want it to read the code of the frameworks and libraries you're using. Or when you want it to find examples of what you're trying to do in open-source code. Or when you want it to connect the dots between your code and its dependencies. Or... well, anytime you want it to find and look up code on GitHub. Here are some example prompts that lead Amp to use the Librarian: • \"Use the Librarian to lookup how React's useEffect cleanup function is implemented.\" • \"Explain how new versions of our documentation are deployed when we release. Search our docs and infra repositories to see how they get to X.Y.sourcegraph.com.\" • \"Ask the Librarian to explain why we're getting this error from Zod and show me the validation logic causing it.\" In order to use the Librarian, all you need to do is configure a GitHub connection in your Amp settings and then tell Amp to use it. !The Librarian at work 5.

Like our default mode in Amp (which is now called smart), Amp Free is a unique combination of system prompt, tools, and a selection of top OSS and frontier models. Models have changed tremendously in the last six months. Many are now great at being agents, and they’re cheaper too. All this means Amp Free is now possible—plenty of good tokens at a discount, a coding agent that knows how to use them, and the Internet’s best business model: advertisements. In turn, we’re now going to make agentic programming accessible to everyone and start exploring what’s possible when good tokens become cheap. Try it: sign in & install Amp, then use /mode free in the Amp CLI, or select free in the prompt field in the Amp editor extension. Read more about Amp Free » 6. October 14, 2025",

      "description": "Today we've launched the Amp TypeScript SDK. It allows you to programmatically use the Amp agent in your TypeScript programs. Here is a program, for example, that instructs the Amp agent to find and list specific files in a folder using a custom toolbox tool: `typescript import { AmpOptions, execute } from '@sourcegraph/amp-sdk' import path from 'path' const prompt = ` What files use authentication in this directory? Go through all the files and folders. Use the format_file_tree tool to format results. Only output the file tree. ` const options: AmpOptions = { cwd: path.join(process.cwd(), 'src'), // Run in ./src folder dangerouslyAllowAll: true, // Allow all tools, trust in Amp toolbox: path.join(process.cwd(), 'toolbox'), // Location of custom toolbox } // execute starts the agent and streams messages const messages = execute({ prompt, options }) for await (const message of messages) { // A system message contains information about the current session if (message.type === 'system') { console.log(Started thread: ${message.session_id}) // For example, the custom tools that were found in the toolbox console.log( 'Available tools in Toolbox: ', message.tools.filter((tool) => tool.startsWith('tb__')).join(', '), ) } else if (message.type === 'assistant') { // An assistant message contains the assistants text replies // or tool uses console.log('Assistant:', message) } else if (message.type === 'result') { // A result message contains the last message of the assistant console.log('Files using authentication:', message.result) } } ` You only need to install one package to get started: `shell-session $ npm install @sourcegraph/amp-sdk ` Since you can invoke Amp in any TypeScript program, there are very few limits to what you can build. Here are some ideas and examples of things we've built internally: • Code Review Agent: Automated pull request analysis and feedback • Documentation Generator: Create and maintain project documentation • Test Automation: Generate and execute test suites • Migration Assistant: Help upgrade codebases and refactor legacy code • CI/CD Integration: Smart build and deployment pipelines • Issue Triage: Automatically categorize and prioritize bug reports To get more ideas and familiar with the SDK, take a look at the examples in the manual. 8.

      "description": "The --try-gpt5 experiment is over. GPT-5 is here to stay as the new model for the oracle, replacing o3, but no longer as an experimental primary model in Amp. We found GPT-5 to be surprisingly good in certain contexts, when planning or debugging, for example, which makes it a great model to take on the role of the oracle. But it's also less proactive, less likely to jump over that last hurdle, compared to Sonnet, and these are qualities we look for in the main agent model. Then again, its reasoning capabilities, its different training lineage, and the absence of certain idiosyncracies make it a great partner for Sonnet. Now GPT-5 is the oracle in Amp. That means you can summon it at any point in an Amp thread to help with complex plans and bugs: • \"Look at the DB query calls and ask the oracle to provide a plan for how to refactor that reduces code duplication\" • \"Use the oracle to figure out when createSupervisor threads can throw an uncaught error based on the debug log output in @log.txt\" • \"I don't like that architecture. Use the oracle to analyze the callers and design a better architecture with clearer separation of concerns and pluggable storage.\" • \"Ask the oracle to review the code we just wrote\" (You can find more examples in the manual.) Thanks to everybody for testing and evaluating GPT-5 and sharing their experiences with us! We're still tweaking system prompts, still exploring new mechanics of how to interact with agents, and still thinking about where else we could fit GPT-5 into Amp. Because it is a fascinating model and there has to be a way to get even more out of it. 9. September 30, 2025",

The tool is then expected to write its description (which is what will end up in the system prompt that's sent to the agent) to stdout. Here is an example: `javascript import fs from 'node:fs' const action = process.env.TOOLBOX_ACTION if (action === 'describe') showDescription() else if (action === 'execute') runTests() function showDescription() { process.stdout.write( JSON.stringify({ name: 'run-tests', description: 'use this tool instead of Bash to run tests in a workspace', args: { dir: ['string', 'the workspace directory'] }, }), ) } ` When the agent then decides to invoke your tool, Amp runs the executable again, this time setting TOOLBOX_ACTION to execute. Amp passes the tool call arguments on stdin and the executable can then execute the tool call: `javascript function runTests() { let dir = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(0, 'utf-8'))['dir'] dir = dir && dir.length > 0 ? dir : '.'

Everything you type after that will be executed as a shell command. The command and its output will be included in the context window the next time you send a message to the agent. It's a good way to show the agent the output of a command without the agent having to execute it. Type $$ and you'll activate the incognito version of shell mode in which the commands are executed in the same way, but not included in the context. That, in turn, is handy when you want to run noisy commands to check on something, or fire off a quick command that you'd otherwise run in a separate terminal. 23. August 20, 2025",

In order to train this model, we rebuilt our training dataset to include synthetically generated examples to improve the model's performance in specific scenarios in which the previous model produced poor or missing suggestions, such as follow-up edits. The new model also uses DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) post-training on top of our SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) base. To do that, we used the model's previous bad outputs as negative examples alongside the new synthetic ground truth as positive examples, teaching it to avoid common failure patterns. Here, see how follow-up edits work much better now. In this video, deleting a proxy variable triggers a chain of completions, including fixes to the constructor and updates to the header. 25.

We've been trying a lot of them, to see whether they can make Amp better. In Amp, a new model isn't just another entry in a model selection dropdown menu. It's part of a whole in which many different models have different jobs to do and for each job we want to use the best model, regardless of cost or deployment concerns. So when a new model comes along, we ask: • Is it a frontier model that can replace Claude Sonnet 4 fully or even partially as the main agent model? • Is it a good subagent model that spikes in certain areas? (Like how the oracle uses a different model, originally o3.) • Is it a fast utility model that we can use, for example, for search, summarization, or other similar tasks? With this post, we want to show you a week in the life of the Amp team as we evaluate new models. Impressions, ideas, tips — we'll share what we discover. We'll continuously update it with notes from Thorsten, Camden, Quinn, Beyang, and other Amp team members. • GPT-5 One Week Later _(latest note)_ • GPT-5 is pretty good after a few days of use • GPT-5, Two First Impressions • Elbow Grease • Try GPT-5 • Try Claude Opus 4.1 • Good Forward-Looking Evals _Last updated: 2mo ago_ See latest notes » 30.

      "description": "Instead of only allowing you to configure which Bash commands are allowed to run and which aren't, Amp now gives you the ability to define which tool it's allowed to run, and with which arguments. When Amp wants to call a tool, it first checks your list of permissions to find an entry that matches the tool and the tool call arguments. The matched entry then tells Amp to either _allow_ the tool call, _reject_ it, _ask_ you for confirmation, or _delegate_ the decision to another program. If no matching entry is found, Amp checks the built-in permission list that contains sensible defaults. You can define these granular tool-level permissions by adding entries to the amp.permissions list in your configuration file. Here's an example: `json \"amp.permissions\": [ // Ask before running a command containing \"git commit\" { \"tool\": \"Bash\", \"matches\": { \"cmd\": \"*git commit*\" }, \"action\": \"ask\"}, // Reject command containing \"python \" or \"python3 \" { \"tool\": \"Bash\", \"matches\": { \"cmd\": [\"*python *\", \"*python3 *\"] }, \"action\": \"reject\"}, // Ask before running any MCP tool { \"tool\": \"mcp__*\", \"action\": \"ask\"}, // Delegate everything else to a permission helper (must be on $PATH) { \"tool\": \"*\", \"action\": \"delegate\", \"to\": \"my-permission-helper\"} ] ` You can read more about the new tool-level permissions in the manual. 33.

It's also slightly more expensive and less suited for day-to-day agentic coding. But it is impressively good at reviewing, at debugging, at analyzing, at figuring out what to do next. That's why we made it available as a tool, so the main agent and the oracle can work together — hand in hand, or, well, the agentic equivalent: token by token, one writing code, the other analyzing and reviewing. We consciously haven't pushed the oracle too hard in the system prompt, to avoid unnecessarily increasing costs for you or slowing you down. Instead, we rely on explicit prompting to get the main agent to consult the oracle. Here are some prompts we used: • \"Use the oracle to review the last commit's changes. I want to make sure that the actual logic for when an idle or requires-user-input notification sound plays has not changed.\" • \"Analyze how the functions foobar and barfoo are used. Then I want you to work a lot with the oracle to figure out how we can refactor the duplication between them while keeping changes backwards compatible.\" • \"I have a bug in these files: ...

      "description": "We've been using and tuning Amp with Claude 4 internally for weeks. Now that Anthropic has released it, we've switched Amp's primary model to be Claude Sonnet 4. Amp is already designed to get the most power out of Claude 4. In our testing, we've found this new model to be: • Faster • More stable, less easily distracted • Smarter at tool calling • More willing to invoke tools in parallel • Better at recovering from errors • Generally more trustworthy To start using Claude 4 in Amp, update to the latest release of Amp's VS Code extension or CLI. No settings changes are needed; see why we don't make the user switch models. 51. May 20, 2025",

      "description": "We removed Isolated Mode, which let you use Amp with your own API keys for LLM inference, because it's not possible for it to meet our quality bar. The intent was to make it easier to use Amp in locked-down environments, but we hit many issues that made the experience bad and slowed us down: 1. Anthropic rate limit issues: Individuals can't easily get Anthropic API keys with high enough rate limits to actually use Amp. (Anthropic is understandably strict here unless you are an enterprise customer of theirs.) 2. LLM proxy and connectivity issues: Many people tried to use Isolated Mode with custom LLM proxies that weren't fully API-compatible with Anthropic's API, which led to hard-to-debug issues. 3. Gemini API parity issues: We found that Gemini 2.5 Pro only works well via Google Cloud Vertex AI (a more enterprise-y offering) rather than Google AI Studio, which is how most people would generate API keys, because of differences in how they handle thinking. Even though we _could_ work around these specific issues, more will arise in the future because tool-calling agents need to integrate more deeply into model capabilities and LLM APIs are getting more complex and differentiated. We believe the best product is built by iterating fast at the model↔product frontier, and most devs and companies want the best coding agent _more_ than they want a worse coding agent that satisfies other constraints. _If you were using Isolated Mode_: When you update Amp in VS Code, you'll see a message informing you of this change and requiring you to disable Isolated Mode to continue. Your threads are preserved locally. 56. May 7, 2025",
