  "strategy": "This deal requires urgent re-activation with a multi-threaded engagement strategy. The account has a strong history (successful $375K renewal in 2024), but the current renewal is dangerously quiet with no recorded touchpoints despite an approaching close date. The silence is the biggest red flag.\n\nImmediate priority: Schedule a business review with technical champions (Alex Sadleir, Deep Ramsokul) to validate current value delivery, usage patterns, and pain points. Simultaneously engage procurement stakeholders (Michael Denari, Sam Forscutt, Patrick Dent) to understand budget cycles and internal approval processes. Use the previous renewal success as social proof and leverage the relationship continuity.\n\nSecondary opportunity: The small CIP MAU expansion ($4K) stuck in validation stage suggests latent expansion potential. Bundle this into the renewal conversation as a value-add rather than a separate deal. Position it as 'continuing innovation' rather than upsell. Use the business review to uncover other team expansion opportunities across their 3,500-employee organization.",
