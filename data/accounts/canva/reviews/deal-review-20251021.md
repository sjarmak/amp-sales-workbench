## Deal Health Score: 42/100
**Status:** At-risk renewal requiring immediate attention. $482K enterprise renewal (900 seats) approaching April 2025 with quote sent but zero documented engagement or follow-up activities.

## Strategy
This deal requires urgent re-activation with a multi-threaded engagement strategy. The account has a strong history (successful $375K renewal in 2024), but the current renewal is dangerously quiet with no recorded touchpoints despite an approaching close date. The silence is the biggest red flag.

Immediate priority: Schedule a business review with technical champions (Alex Sadleir, Deep Ramsokul) to validate current value delivery, usage patterns, and pain points. Simultaneously engage procurement stakeholders (Michael Denari, Sam Forscutt, Patrick Dent) to understand budget cycles and internal approval processes. Use the previous renewal success as social proof and leverage the relationship continuity.

Secondary opportunity: The small CIP MAU expansion ($4K) stuck in validation stage suggests latent expansion potential. Bundle this into the renewal conversation as a value-add rather than a separate deal. Position it as 'continuing innovation' rather than upsell. Use the business review to uncover other team expansion opportunities across their 3,500-employee organization.

## Path to Close
1) Week 1: Internal prep - review 2024 renewal notes, usage data, support tickets; 2) Week 2: Outreach to Alex Sadleir and Deep Ramsokul for 30-min sync on current state; 3) Week 3: Business review with SCM team showcasing ROI and usage metrics; 4) Week 4: Procurement alignment call with Michael Denari on renewal timeline and process; 5) Month 2: Address any technical or commercial objections uncovered; 6) Month 3: Execute renewal with expansion attached; 7) Establish quarterly check-ins to prevent future silent periods.

## Champions
- Alex Sadleir (Head of Source Control Team / Sponsor) - HIGH influence, technical decision-maker for SCM team, primary champion
- Deep Ramsokul (Source Control Engineering Manager) - MEDIUM-HIGH influence, day-to-day team lead, technical validator

## Blockers
- Complete lack of documented engagement - no calls, no activities, no relationship visibility into current sentiment
- Unknown competitive landscape - no intelligence on whether competitors are being evaluated
- Procurement involvement unclear - quote sent but no documented procurement discussions or timeline alignment
- CIP MAU expansion stalled in validation with no clear next steps or stakeholder engagement

## Objections
- Implied budget concern - small $4K expansion stuck suggests potential cost sensitivity or competing priorities
- Implied value uncertainty - lack of proactive renewal discussion may indicate unclear ROI or reduced usage
- Potential procurement complexity - multiple procurement contacts suggest formal process may slow decision-making

## Risk Factors
- ðŸ”´ **Renewal ghost risk - zero engagement 6 months before close date on $482K deal**
  - Mitigation: Immediate outreach this week to technical champions with business review offer; escalate internally if no response within 5 days
- ðŸ”´ **Competitive displacement - no visibility into whether competitors are engaging during this silent period**
  - Mitigation: Use business review to ask directly about other tools being evaluated; position renewal as expansion of successful partnership
- ðŸŸ¡ **Budget reallocation - renewal may be at risk due to shifting priorities or budget cuts**
  - Mitigation: Engage procurement early to understand budget cycles and approval timelines; prepare ROI documentation showing value delivered
- ðŸŸ¡ **Multi-stakeholder complexity - 4+ procurement contacts plus technical team suggests lengthy approval process**
  - Mitigation: Map out decision-making process early; identify economic buyer; build champion coalition across technical and procurement
- ðŸŸ¢ **Expansion deal distraction - small CIP MAU deal may be diverting attention from larger renewal**
  - Mitigation: Bundle expansion into renewal conversation as value-add; simplify to single negotiation rather than parallel deals

## Coaching Tips
- Act with urgency - this deal is silent and at risk. Block time today to craft personalized outreach to Alex Sadleir referencing past success and offering business review.
- Leverage 2024 renewal win - use social proof from previous successful $375K renewal to build confidence and continuity. Reference specific wins or value delivered.
- Multi-thread aggressively - don't rely solely on technical champions. Get procurement (Michael Denari) engaged now to understand their timeline and process.
- Document everything - start logging all activities in Salesforce and recording calls in Gong immediately. This visibility gap is dangerous.
- Ask discovery questions as if this were new business - you don't know their current sentiment, challenges, or competitive landscape. Approach with curiosity, not assumptions.
- Bundle the expansion - don't let the small $4K CIP MAU expansion slow down the renewal. Position it as 'enhanced package' in the renewal conversation.
- Set mutual close plan - during first re-engagement call, propose shared timeline with milestones leading to renewal. Get buyer commitment to dates.
- Prepare for procurement rigor - with 3 procurement contacts, expect formal RFP or vendor evaluation process. Get ahead of it with value documentation.
