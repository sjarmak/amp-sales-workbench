## Problem Statement
Canva's 3,500-person engineering organization needs to maintain code quality and security at scale while enabling rapid feature development. With a distributed SCM team managing source control for a high-growth design platform, they require intelligent tooling to catch vulnerabilities early, streamline code review, and maintain development velocity.

## Solution Fit
Sourcegraph Code Intelligence platform provides Canva's SCM team (900 seats) with comprehensive code search, security scanning, and automated code review capabilities across their entire codebase. This directly supports their source control operations led by Alex Sadleir and Deep Ramsokul, enabling faster incident response, proactive vulnerability management, and improved developer productivity.

## Success Metrics
- 70% reduction in time to locate and fix security vulnerabilities across the codebase
- 40% faster code review cycles for 900-seat engineering team
- 90% of critical code patterns identified before production deployment

## Social Proof
- Similar large-scale design and creative technology companies use Sourcegraph to manage complex codebases with distributed engineering teams
- Successfully renewed in 2024 with 700 seats ($375K), expanded by $37K in August 2024 - demonstrating proven value and adoption

## Next Steps
- Schedule renewal discussion with procurement (Michael Denari, Sam Forscutt) and SCM leadership (Alex Sadleir, Deep Ramsokul) by end of October - $482K renewal closes April 28, 2025
- Conduct business review to quantify ROI, uncover expansion needs, and validate CIP MAU expansion opportunity ($4K)
- Document current usage patterns and feature gaps to derisk renewal and identify upsell opportunities
