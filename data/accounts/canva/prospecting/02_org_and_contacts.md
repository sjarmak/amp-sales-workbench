## Buying Committee Dynamics

### Decision-Making Process (Inferred - Medium Confidence)

**Stage 1: Technical Evaluation**
- Engineering Directors/Group Leads conduct hands-on trials
- Evaluate against existing tools (likely GitHub Copilot, possibly Cursor)
- Run internal pilots with 5-10 engineers across teams

**Stage 2: Engineering Leadership Review**
- VP Engineering reviews productivity metrics, team feedback, pricing
- CTO weighs in on strategic fit with AI-augmented development culture
- Security/Compliance review (critical for IP protection)

**Stage 3: Procurement & Rollout**
- IT/Security approval for SSO integration
- Phased rollout: Start with 1-2 teams, expand to 626 engineers
- Success metrics: API development velocity, code review cycle time, onboarding time

### Influencers & Champions

**Internal Champions to Identify**:
- Engineering managers who authored experimentation platform blog post
- Early adopters of AI tools in engineering interviews
- Platform engineering leads building internal tools
- Engineers active in developer community (conference speakers, blog authors)

**External Validation**:
- AWS partnership (Canva presented at re:Invent) - Amp's AWS integrations relevant
- Canva's MCP server announcement - Amp supports MCP integration
- Fortune 500 peer references - 95% already use Canva, likely have similar needs
