#### 4. **Subagents for Parallel Development**

**Canva's Challenge**: 626 engineers across Sydney, Manila, London, Austin, Beijing working on massive codebase

**Amp's Edge**:
- **Parallel subagents** for independent tasks ([Amp Manual](https://ampcode.com/manual#subagents))
- Convert CSS to Tailwind across multiple components simultaneously
- Handle complex migrations with isolated agents

**Competitive Gap**: Other tools process serially; Amp can parallelize work to match Canva's scale.

#### 5. **AGENTS.md for Engineering Standards**

**Canva's Challenge**: Maintaining code quality and consistency across distributed global teams

**Amp's Edge**:
- **AGENTS.md guidance system** for codebase conventions ([Amp Manual](https://ampcode.com/manual#agents-md))
- Specify build, test, lint commands once
- Language-specific rules with glob patterns

**Competitive Gap**: Canva can encode their engineering standards once, ensuring all AI-generated code follows their conventions - critical for their scale.

#### 6. **JetBrains Support for Java Development**

**Canva's Tech Stack**: Java is in their stack ([Canva Engineering Blog](https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/how-we-build-experiments-in-house/), 2024-06-27)

- Native support for IntelliJ-based workflows

**Competitive Gap**: Better Java development experience than Cursor (VS Code-based).

## "So What for the Demo?"

### What to Show Canva's CTO and Engineering Leaders

#### **Demo Scenario 1: Navigating Microservices Complexity**

**Setup**: "You mentioned evolving from a monolith to microservices handling 1.2M requests/day. Let's say you need to trace a bug across multiple services."

**Show**:
1. **Librarian** searching across multiple repositories to find service dependencies
2. **1M token context** loading 10+ service files simultaneously
3. **Oracle** analyzing the architectural flow and identifying the root cause
4. **Multi-file edits** fixing the issue across 3 services in one operation

**Impact**: "Traditional AI coding tools can't hold this much context. You'd be switching between tools, losing context, manually connecting the dots. Amp keeps everything in working memory."

#### **Demo Scenario 2: AI Feature Development (Leonardo.Ai/MagicBrief Integration)**

**Setup**: "With Leonardo.Ai and MagicBrief acquisitions, you're integrating new AI capabilities rapidly. Let's integrate a new AI model endpoint."

**Show**:
1. **Subagents** working in parallel: one updates API client, another adds TypeScript types, third writes tests
2. **AGENTS.md** enforcing Canva's coding standards automatically
3. **Amp Tab completions** suggesting next implementation steps based on diagnostics
4. **Oracle** reviewing the integration for security, performance, error handling

**Impact**: "You told Fortune you're hiring engineers who work intelligently with AI. This is that workflow. Engineers stay in strategic mode while Amp handles the implementation details - exactly what you're looking for."

#### **Demo Scenario 3: Developer Platform API Development**

**Setup**: "Your developer platform hit 1 billion uses. Let's add a new API endpoint to your Content Query API."

**Show**:
1. **Read existing API patterns** from codebase using Grep/finder
2. **Generate new endpoint** matching Canva's conventions via AGENTS.md
3. **Write OpenAPI spec** and implementation simultaneously
4. **Add tests** that follow existing test patterns
5. **Run build/check commands** to verify everything works

**Impact**: "This took 3 minutes. With Copilot, you'd get code suggestions but still manually wire up tests, docs, validation. Amp understands your entire development workflow."

## Key Objections and Responses

### "We already use GitHub Copilot across the team"

**Response**: "Copilot is great for line-level completions. But you're working at a different scale now - 1.2M requests/day across microservices, integrating AI acquisitions, managing a developer platform with 1B uses. You need a tool that understands your entire architecture, not just the next line. That's what Amp's 1M token context and Oracle provide. Think of Amp as your senior engineer pair programming, while Copilot is autocomplete."

### "How is this different from Cursor?"

**Response**: "Three critical differences for Canva:
1. **Scale**: Amp's context windows are 5-10x larger - essential for your microservices complexity
2. **Reasoning**: Oracle gives you GPT-5 architectural guidance, not just code generation
3. **Extensibility**: MCP integration means Amp works with your internal tools - you already publish an MCP server, so this is a natural fit

Cursor is excellent for smaller codebases. At 626 engineers and your architectural complexity, you need Amp's capabilities."

### "AI tools hallucinate and produce buggy code"

**Response**: "Valid concern. That's why Amp has:
1. **AGENTS.md**: Your conventions become enforceable rules, not suggestions
2. **Oracle review mode**: GPT-5 reviews code before it goes out
3. **Lint/test integration**: Amp runs your existing quality checks automatically
4. **Tool permissions**: You control exactly what Amp can do

You told Fortune you want engineers who use AI 'intelligently' - Amp's design embodies that intelligence through guardrails and oversight."

### "This will replace our engineers"

**Response**: "Brendan said it perfectly in his Fortune interview - you're looking for engineers who work intelligently WITH AI tools. Amp makes your 626 engineers more effective, not redundant. They spend time on architecture, product decisions, complex debugging - the high-value work. Amp handles the mechanical coding. You're shipping more features with the same team, not fewer features with fewer people."

## Pricing Context

**Canva's Scale**: 626 engineers

**Amp Enterprise Pricing** ([Amp Manual](https://ampcode.com/manual#pricing)):
- SSO integration
- Zero data retention option (critical for Canva's IP)
- Managed org-wide settings
- Pooled billing
- Team workspaces

**Estimated Investment**: ~$50-60/engineer/month for 626 seats = ~$375K-450K annually

**ROI Calculation**:
- **30% productivity gain** (conservative) Ã— 626 engineers = 188 engineer-equivalents
- At $150K loaded cost/engineer = **$28M annual value**
- **ROI: 62-75x**

**Comparable Investments**: Canva spent $22.5M on MagicBrief acquisition ([Forbes Australia](https://www.forbes.com.au/news/innovation/canva-to-acquire-australian-ai-platform-magicbrief/), 2025-06-18). Amp delivers similar strategic value for 2% of that cost.

## Next Steps
