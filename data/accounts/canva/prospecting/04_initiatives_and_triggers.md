"Hi Brendan,

I saw your comments in Fortune about changing Canva's engineering assessments to evaluate AI tool competency. That's a bold strategic move - and exactly the shift we're seeing at other high-growth companies.

Amp is the enterprise AI coding assistant built for engineers who use AI *intelligently* - not just autocomplete. With 1M token context windows, GPT-5 powered architectural review (Oracle), and integration with your internal tools via MCP, Amp handles the complex work you described at re:Invent: microservices debugging, large-scale refactoring, and acquisition integration.

Given your recent MagicBrief acquisition and developer platform expansion, I'd love to show you how Amp can make your 626 engineers 3-5x faster on complex tasks.

Worth 20 minutes?"

### Alternative Entry Points

1. **Via Developer Platform Team**: "You're building APIs for 300 apps. Want to ship faster with auto-generated tests and docs?"
2. **Via Engineering Directors**: "Managing microservices complexity? Amp's large context helps engineers understand cross-service dependencies."
3. **Via Recruiting/Talent**: "You're hiring for AI tool competency. Shouldn't you equip your current team with enterprise AI coding tools?"

### Discovery Questions

1. "You changed interview assessments to test AI tool usage - what tools are your engineers currently using?"
2. "How is the MagicBrief integration going? What's been most challenging about merging the codebases?"
3. "Your developer platform hit 1B uses - what's the biggest bottleneck in shipping new APIs?"
4. "You discussed microservices complexity at re:Invent - how do engineers currently debug cross-service issues?"
5. "With 626 engineers across 5 locations, how do you maintain code consistency?"

## Risk Mitigation

### Objection: "We already have GitHub Copilot"

**Response**: 
"Copilot is excellent for line-level completions - keep using it. Amp complements Copilot for architecture-level work:
- Understanding dependencies across your microservices (1M token context)
- Reviewing complex refactoring plans before execution (Oracle with GPT-5)
- Integrating acquired codebases like MagicBrief (Finder + large context)
- Making consistent changes across multiple services (subagents)

Think of Copilot as autocomplete, Amp as your senior engineer pair programmer. Your CTO wants engineers who use AI tools *intelligently* - that means knowing when you need deep reasoning and large context, not just autocomplete."

### Objection: "Our engineers are already very productive"

**Response**:
"Absolutely - 240M users and $2.7B revenue prove it. But your CTO is explicitly hiring for engineers who can use AI tools to be 3-5x more productive. That's the strategic bet: already-great engineers become exceptional with the right AI tools. Amp is the enterprise tool that delivers on that vision with security, scale, and SOC 2 compliance."

### Objection: "We build our own internal tools"

**Response**:
"That's impressive - your experimentation platform is a great example. Amp actually accelerates building *more* internal tools. Plus, Amp integrates with your internal tools via MCP, so your engineers can access Canva-specific workflows right in their coding assistant. The teams who built your experimentation platform could build the next one 3x faster with Amp."

### Objection: "We need to see ROI"

**Response**:
"Fair. Typical Amp customers see:
- 3-5x faster on complex tasks (refactoring, debugging, integration)
- 50% faster onboarding for new engineers
- Fewer production bugs from better testing and code review

With 626 engineers, even a 20% productivity gain is 125 full-time engineers worth of output. At your engineer cost (~$200K loaded), that's $25M annual value. Amp pays for itself in the first month.

Want to pilot with your developer platform team or AI features team first?"
