## üìù Notes

**Data Quality Alert:** This account has significant data gaps that limit visibility into relationship health and deal status. The lack of recent engagement data (calls, meetings, activities) is concerning given the size and timing of the upcoming renewal.

**Historical Context:** Previous renewal (April 2024) was successfully closed for $375K with 700 seats. Current renewal represents growth to 900 seats (+29% seat expansion), suggesting positive usage trends. However, without recent engagement, we cannot confirm current satisfaction or identify potential objections.

**Recommended Approach:** Lead with value-add conversation (usage insights, ROI, roadmap preview) rather than transactional renewal discussion. Use this as opportunity to rebuild engagement cadence and identify expansion opportunities beyond the current renewal scope.
