## üó£Ô∏è Recent Interactions

**‚ö†Ô∏è No Recent Call Data**

Last documented technical engagement was October 2024 discussing "Cody for Code Reviews" use case. This 6-month silence is concerning given the renewal timeline.

## üö® Risks & Objections

- **Engagement Gap:** No documented calls or technical discussions since October 2024, despite $482K renewal in flight
- **Renewal Risk:** Quote sent but no visibility into procurement timeline or technical validation progress
- **Expansion Justification:** 200-seat increase (29% expansion) requires ROI validation, but no recent data on usage or success metrics
- **Silent Period:** 6-month gap raises questions about product satisfaction, competing priorities, or competitive displacement

## üéØ Recommended Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Pre-call prep for March 20 Deep Ramsokul meeting** - Gather usage analytics, success metrics from 2024, and ROI analysis to validate 900-seat expansion
2. **Follow up with Sam Forscutt** - Re-engage procurement contact (last touch Jan 19) to understand internal approval timeline and budget status

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Conduct ROI validation call with Deep Ramsokul on March 20** - Present usage data, success metrics, and business case for 200-seat expansion
2. **Schedule technical check-in with Alex Sadleir** - Re-engage champion (last contact Oct 2024) to assess satisfaction and uncover any silent objections
3. **Document success stories from 2024 renewal** - Create case study of SCM team wins to support renewal business case

### Strategic
1. **Revive Cody for Code Reviews discussion** - Last explored in October 2024, could be expansion opportunity beyond renewal
2. **Multi-threading strategy** - Expand relationships beyond SCM team to other engineering leaders (Fawaz Ahmed, Denis Silva, Christian Scott)

## üí° Key Insights

- **Competitive Position:** No mentions of competitors (but silence could indicate quiet evaluation)
- **Feature Requests:** None documented (concerning - suggests lack of product engagement discussions)
- **Feedback Trends:** No recent feedback data available - critical gap for renewal validation
- **Historical Success:** Strong track record with 2024 renewal closing successfully, indicating product-market fit with SCM team
- **Expansion Signal:** 29% seat growth (700‚Üí900) suggests genuine usage growth, but needs validation

---

## üìù Notes

**Critical Timeline:** April 4 and April 28 close dates are approaching rapidly. The March 20 meeting with Deep Ramsokul is the most important engagement opportunity before renewal decision point.

**Investigation Needed:** Why the 6-month engagement gap? Possible scenarios:
- Product working well, no need for support (good)
- Team distracted by other priorities (neutral)
- Silent dissatisfaction or competitive evaluation (bad)

**Quick Win:** Convert the March 20 meeting into full renewal validation - bring usage data, success metrics, and expansion justification. This is make-or-break for the renewal timeline.
