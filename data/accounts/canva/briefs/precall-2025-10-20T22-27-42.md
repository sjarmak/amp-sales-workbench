## üìù Predicted Agenda

- ROI validation for 2024 deployment (700 seats) - metrics, usage, value delivered
- Justification for expansion from 700 to 900 seats - which teams/use cases driving growth
- Budget and procurement timeline for April 28 close date
- Cody for Code Reviews update - status since October 2024 conversation
- Success criteria and metrics for 2025 contract

## ‚ùì Key Questions to Ask

**Metrics:**
- What ROI have you seen from the 700-seat deployment in 2024? (Time saved, code quality, onboarding speed)
- Can you quantify developer time saved per week using code search and navigation?
- What metrics would justify expanding from 700 to 900 seats to procurement?
- How do you currently measure Source Control team productivity and code intelligence value?

**Economic Buyer:**
- Who besides Michael Denari needs to approve the $482K renewal?
- What's the approval process and timeline for technology contracts of this size?
- Is budget already allocated for the renewal or does it need to be secured?
- Are there any budget cuts or freezes we should be aware of for Q2 2025?

**Decision Criteria:**
- What criteria is Canva using to evaluate code intelligence platforms in 2025?
- How do you prioritize: developer productivity vs code quality vs onboarding speed?
- Are you evaluating alternatives or is this a straightforward renewal decision?
- What would need to be true to expand beyond 900 seats in the future?

**Decision Process:**
- What are the steps between now and April 28 to get this closed?
- Who needs to sign off: Alex, Fawaz, Michael? Anyone else?
- When does the contract need to be with legal for review?
- Is there an executive business review or QBR planned before renewal?

**Identify Pain:**
- What would happen if the Source Control team didn't have Sourcegraph for 30 days?
- What code intelligence challenges remain unsolved with the current deployment?
- How are the additional 200 users currently managing without Sourcegraph access?
- What pain points drove the original 700-seat purchase in 2024?

**Champion:**
- Alex - How can we help you build the internal business case for the 900-seat expansion?
- Deep - What data or case studies would help you justify this to Fawaz and procurement?
- Who else should we be engaging to strengthen support for the renewal?
- What concerns or questions is the executive team asking about this renewal?

**Blockers:**
- Is the 6-month engagement gap creating any doubts about value or usage?
- Are there competing budget priorities that could delay or reduce the renewal?
- Has there been any negative feedback from the 700 users that could impact renewal?
- Is security (Ronald Tan, Geoff Chiang) satisfied with our security posture?
- Are there any concerns about the price increase from $375K (2024) to $482K (2025)?

**Success Criteria:**
- What does success look like for the Source Control team in 2025?
- How will you measure whether the 900-seat deployment was worth it?
- What would make you expand beyond 900 seats in H2 2025?
- What metrics should we track together to demonstrate ongoing value?

## üéØ Demo Focus Areas

### Code Search & Navigation at Scale
**Reason:** Core use case for 3500-employee engineering org with complex monorepo/polyrepo setup
**Pain Points:**
- Finding code across large codebase
- Onboarding new engineers
- Understanding code dependencies

### Cody for Code Reviews
**Reason:** Last discussed in October 2024 - follow-up opportunity. Addresses code quality and review efficiency.
**Pain Points:**
- Manual PR review time
- Inconsistent code review quality
- Reviewer availability bottlenecks

### Usage Analytics & ROI Dashboard
**Reason:** Critical for justifying 700‚Üí900 seat expansion to procurement. Show adoption metrics and value delivered.
**Pain Points:**
- Proving ROI to finance
- Understanding which teams get most value
- Optimizing license allocation

### Batch Changes for Large-Scale Refactoring
**Reason:** Developer productivity at scale - relevant for 3500-person engineering org doing platform migrations
**Pain Points:**
- Cross-repo refactoring complexity
- Technical debt cleanup at scale
- Keeping dependencies updated

## ‚öîÔ∏è Competitive Landscape

_No competitive mentions found_

## üí° Custom Demo/Trial Ideas

1. **Executive Business Review (EBR) with Fawaz Ahmed**
   - **Reasoning:** 6-month engagement gap + $482K renewal + no recent executive touchpoint = risk. EBR builds relationship and validates strategic value.
   - **Evidence:**
     - No documented interaction with Sr Director of Engineering
     - Previous successful renewal in 2024 ($375K)
     - Expansion indicates growth but needs executive validation

2. **ROI Case Study from 2024 Deployment**
   - **Reasoning:** Turn Deep's March 20 call into a joint case study. Use their success story to justify expansion and support future expansions.
   - **Evidence:**
     - Successfully deployed 700 seats in 2024
     - Expanding to 900 seats indicates value
     - Procurement needs quantifiable ROI for approval

3. **Pilot Cody for Code Reviews with 2-3 Teams**
   - **Reasoning:** Resurrect October 2024 conversation. Small pilot proves value and creates expansion opportunity beyond 900 seats.
   - **Evidence:**
     - Topic discussed in October 2024
     - Code review efficiency is universal pain point
     - Low-risk way to demonstrate additional value

4. **Usage & Adoption Analysis Workshop**
   - **Reasoning:** Help Deep optimize the 700 seats currently deployed. Show which teams are power users, identify underutilized licenses, plan 200-seat expansion strategically.
   - **Evidence:**
     - Expanding from 700 to 900 suggests some teams don't have access yet
     - Usage analytics help maximize ROI
     - Positions us as strategic partner not just vendor
