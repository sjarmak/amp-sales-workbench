## ‚öîÔ∏è Competitive Landscape

_No competitive mentions found_

## üí° Custom Demo/Trial Ideas

1. **Pre-renewal ROI report with usage data from 2024 deployment**
   - **Reasoning:** Procurement will need quantifiable justification for 29% increase and 200-seat expansion
   - **Evidence:**
     - Quote already sent but no recent engagement
     - Sam Forscutt (procurement) is primary contact
     - Previous successful renewal ($375K) suggests good relationship but need to re-prove value

2. **Executive Business Review with Alex Sadleir and Fawaz Ahmed**
   - **Reasoning:** Re-engage champion and get executive sponsorship after 6-month gap
   - **Evidence:**
     - Alex Sadleir last engaged October 2024
     - Fawaz Ahmed (Senior Director) never engaged but likely influences budget decisions
     - Need executive alignment for $482K commitment

3. **Pilot expansion to 50 additional users before full 900-seat commit**
   - **Reasoning:** Lower risk way to validate expansion value if there's hesitation about jump from 700 to 900
   - **Evidence:**
     - 6-month engagement gap may indicate uncertainty
     - 29% price increase may require incremental proof

4. **Success story: How Canva's Source Control team uses Sourcegraph**
   - **Reasoning:** Turn them into a reference and build internal champion momentum
   - **Evidence:**
     - 700-seat deployment in 2024 was successful (renewed)
     - Source Control team is clear, defined user base
     - Graphic design platform at scale is compelling use case
