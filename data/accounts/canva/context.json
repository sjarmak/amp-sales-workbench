background first.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Hi, isuru.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Hi there.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: How are you?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah, good.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yes, thank.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You both for agreeing to meet me.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'll quickly introduce myself and kind of explain why I wanted to catch up with you both.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So my name is isuru.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'm an amp field engineer.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'm based out of Sydney Australia.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And really what I do is I spend most of my time working with our customers on either the most complex use cases or helping them figure out a new use case or just onboard existing users, things like that, but mostly focusing with advanced users.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So I was looking in the grab data and it seemed like both of you are consistently using top amp users.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So I guess I just wanted to kind of introduce myself and just understand more about what you're doing your workflows because we're also thinking about putting a guide or an article out.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: We're still not sure about some of the processes our customers are doing, like how they're using amp.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So we're just trying to get the information just to understand.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Cool.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So maybe I'll just pass it over to each one of you to introduce yourselves.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then maybe we can go through your workflow in a bit more detail.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Okay.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I think, let me start first.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So I'm a software engineer in grab senior software engineer.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then I work for like around four years already.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So right now, our task is actually doing some service to service kind of authentications.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then we were exploring a technology called spiffy.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So basically… it's like a low level kind of like a logic that allows a service to automatically get some identity.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: But so in short, what I'm doing with amp is that we found that there is like an open source code that applies this spiffy, they call it spire.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then there is also a helm chart version of implementing it.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: They call it harden helm chart.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then now my task is to convert this helm chart into a terraform code so that it can be used within our organizations.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So how do I use the amp, I have a multiple id, open up.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: One is the open source harden helm chart.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: If there's any questions regarding on what they actually does, how many configs are available, then I will ask this amp to find the answers for me.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I have another id open up which is the terraform code.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So if there is any, like if I want to like, for example, convert the harden helm chart into terraform code, then I'll ask this amp to like do the conversions for me.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And at the same time there's another id open up for the underlying spire source code.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: This is more in depth like a low level kind of logic.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: If there's something wrong happening on the harden helm chart, I need to go into the spire into the original open source code to figure out what's wrong.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Then I will have another amp there.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And I'll ask the amp to try to troubleshoot for me.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And at the same time, I have one more id, open up for the testing.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, for example, if I have a readme that says that how to do the local set up, you need to maybe create these resources and then change the config and then apply this resource.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then after you run this resource, you create another resource.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: It's kind of like a, very long list of how to do stuff.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: But because it's very repetitive.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So I find that gbt works well with this.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I can just ask the gbt to just run the readme, and then it can just run everything and output the result for me.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: If there's any issue, then I ask it to try to troubleshoot.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So for me, my task is a little bit of multitasking.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: If something is running on this IDE, I go and proceed to the other IDE to do other stuff.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah, I think.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So that's you, it said earlier that going through the readme, you said going to gbt, do you mean gbt?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Or do you mean amp, or you actually use chatgpt?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Basically, amp.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Oh, amp.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Cool.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: All good.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So you have, and when you say you have ides open, do you mean you have the amp cli open for different directories?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Different repository?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah, different repositories, but you're using the amp cli, right?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah… or the VS?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Code extension?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, VS code?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Oh, VS code extension.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So you'll have like four to five VS code instances open and you're going through depending on the repos, you'll kick off one job that could take however long it takes.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then you're going on to the next one, working through the next issue.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So you're kind of multitasking multiple agents at the same time.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Ah, yes.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Nice.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Occasionally, when I need to generate some docs to upload my findings, I will maybe create another like a personal folder or something like that.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then I ask him to like maybe summarize the observation so far, convert it into like a sop, so that normal maybe on call users knows how to actually install it after we make this public, make this into production.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Nice.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then in terms of how, like what about amp, like how are you finding it for?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Like this type of workflow?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: What do you like?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: What do you don't like?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, I think what I like is that sometimes it is a bit proactive.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Like if I ask it to do something, it knows that it don't just follow what I do.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Sometimes, sometimes it will try to, okay, you have this error, let me fix this for you.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Something like that.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: If I ask it to follow my readme, it won't just blindly follow it and then say, oh, has an error.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So I will solve it, will try to troubleshoot by itself and then attempt to do something different than what's stated in the readme.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: But I will say sometimes it is a good and bad thing.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Sometimes if it goes very wrong, then you have to ask it to restart everything again.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, yeah, and also, I think maybe… you have already patched it.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: But previously, there is like a parallel task exclusions features.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then I get really, it's not good in my experience because the agent attempts to run all the tasks, all the sequential tasks together in parallel.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And in the end, it all fails because they're supposed to be sequential.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Oh, I see.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So if you ask it to use, I think sub agents is what we call it.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So if you ask it to use sub agents, sometimes it will go to the task list, but some of those tasks should have been done sequentially and it didn't figure it out.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yes, yes.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: But I'm not sure if it's a sub agent because I think it's the same agent that runs multiple tasks at the same time.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Oh, I see.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Maybe it's a bug or something.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Is it editing the same file or?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: They run different cli together?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Different cli together.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: But I think there's only intermediate issues.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I think maybe you have already patched it because I don't see it runs the task parallel really now.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So I think if you want to run something in parallel, you need to ask to use sub agents, and generally, it's pretty good because it'll figure out based on the prompt, what it needs to run, what can be run in parallel, and what needs to be sequential.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, I would recommend trying that also, you mentioned like sometimes it will go wrong and I use the VS code extension.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Have you seen the feature?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It's a little bit subtle where you hover over your last message and you can see like it has the cut like you can restore back to that point.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Have you seen that feature?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I seen that, but I didn't know I can do that.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah, it sounds handy for if you get stuck into those types of situations, I'm just trying to see if I have an example.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'm just trying to find a long thread that I have just to check.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Okay.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I found the line.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I thought you just, oh, so there's a restore button, and then if I click on the restore button, it will revert everything every change that it does.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah, it should keep track of that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah, give that a go.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It might, so you should kind of have the freedom to go, let it do its thing and you're like, ah, you missed the mark there.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You can go back but also, you can fork a thread.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So you're like, okay, we've got a bit of a plan.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: This could go either way.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'll you could revert back to here, then fork it and try something crazy and then be like, okay, that didn't work, then come back and then we're like, okay, we'll go back down to this path.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So there's some like advanced features you could experiment with.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I think I might help your workflow, but.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Does it actually does, is it just the file revert the file changes or also the environment as well?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: It should?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Be, from what I remember, it should just be the file changes and the conversation like the context as well.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Okay.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I think some of my readme commands is actual installations in the local machines.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, maybe that, yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe not so good for your given your it's like calling bash commands and things like that… more useful for like preserving context.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Cool.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: All right.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Well, that's cool.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: There's a few more things that I'll come back to there.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But Hoang, do you want to maybe same question to you?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: If you could give me a little bit of an overview and then go through in some detail about your workflow that'd be great?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: So my name is sang.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: So don't say much, right?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I am an android developer.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: So my, so every day I have to do the android dev for our features.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: So what I usually do is I'm using android studio and I install the amp plugin like this.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: You see here, right?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, because I got external monitor.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: So my monitor is quite big then I will got, I can see on the left in my android studio call like this.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: And on the right is, the amp terminal like this.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: And I, this is what I prefer to do every day and I, so usually I tapping the problem to do to let it do for my, and I, so we've defined a few custom command like this, like if I want to ask them help me to build the app or help them help me check out new plans or stack my android device.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Oh, nice.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: This one just help me to stack android device and capture the videos to insert and save to desktop for me.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: A few, a few tasks like for my project specific, like running with the plan or help me to write mr, with my GitHub token, then post notification to the channel, publish something like that.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I've got a month for me to do like this… during my development.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: If I have the new rules, I will tap in here to add them, help me to add into the agent files and also where the custom can make a global level.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I mean, that other project also can use my commands… but I think also that three issue I observe is first one is the same with backend when the token, you know, the number of token in raising, right?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: For example, I saw, yeah, this is a good one is I found that the number of token is quite big.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: It's about three six eight K tokens.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: It's quite big in my opinion.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: But when the number of token used become bigger and bigger, then the arms become raised somehow.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: It do a lot of things wrongly.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, this is what I observe when the token, when number of token window in raising like I use about 20 percent, 30 percent.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I don't remember exactly.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: But when I observing the number of token used in raising, then the arm become raised for me.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: It do a lot of things wrongly.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I had to stop.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I see.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then what I usually do is when a new token, it become bigger, right?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I usually knew like I knew, yeah, it's very important for me that I come back.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, but I can observe that it's become uncontrollable.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: When number of token become bigger, it do a lot of things wrongly for me.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: And if I use the arms with the external terminal like this, it's perfect for me in terms of performance.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: But if I use with android studio, I feel, I think there are two issues I observe.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: For example, you see like this, I cannot control the buffer, this one they run.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: You see, they auto run by itself.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I release my cursor… here.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then this one run by itself.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: It keeps running.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, you see like this, it keeps running by itself.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: And the worst case is I can see this one I meet every day, a lot of time it become, I don't know how to say, it's not get points.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Blah blah blah blah.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then it stop by itself.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: It stop by itself.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I have to fork stop and I go to the browser like this.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then I leak this one.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then I copy here.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Like this.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then I resume by myself because it lost a lot of contact and it close by itself.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: If I use amp plugin with android studio.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Do you have a thread that you could share with support?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Where that's happened?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Where like.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, today morning, I have, but like today morning, I have, yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: If you find one and you can slack it to me, that would be great because I.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: think, yeah, I got one this morning.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: The reason why I open like this because I got to it's blah blah blah.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I mean, I don't know how to say, but it look like it stopped.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then it got a lot of noise, blah blah blah, a lot of noise like this and make the laptop making noise with blah blah blah, then it keep, oh.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So your laptop's also like working, you can feel the fans kicking in and things like that.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, the, yeah, I, the noise is like something like blah blah blah.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I have, then it's stuck by itself.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I have to close the, I need to click here to close the amp.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then I use the, and I resume the text like this.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I go to here.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then I copy like this.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then I then I resume the text by myself.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: That's it.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I've not actually heard of anyone report that issue.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, so is it that it's still?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Like it's still running the inference?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Like see, it says running tools, is it something still running?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Or it just feels like it's stuck from what you can see?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: And I try to use now and I, somehow I can predicate for you but it's stuck.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: So it's and it brings something random.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I don't know why, how does it bring something random?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: A lot of noise, a lot of noise, but, yeah, I hate to force, sorry, my laptop ran out.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I see when you say noise, you mean physically from your machine, right?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Like like the hardware?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: No, I don't think, I can use the other like terminal, I can use, I can use browser, I can use slack.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I can use the cursor, something like that?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Right?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It's just android studio, yes.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: But I still only for the amp here, they got, the stuff, something like that, something with a lot of noise.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Well, let's do this then.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So next time because I'm sure it'll happen again, if it happens again, send me a note on slack and then you can share a thread with support.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So if you go, let me just check if it's in.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: If you go to that thread in the website or you do from the cli, I think it's slash share, you'll be able to share a thread with support.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then we can have a closer look as to what's going on there because I'm yeah, I'm sure our team will want to fix that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: If we can understand a bit more about it.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, if it happens, I will record video and send to you and your slack or something like that.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, by the way, just as you mentioned that we can revert to our message, right?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: How do we revert here?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, in the cli, I don't know if we have that feature yet.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Let me just double check.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: We're changing like every day there's like multiple releases a day.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Okay.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: You see, the first issue, I tell you, right?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I shrunk down but keep zoom.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, you see like this.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: It cannot at the end.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I mean, the cursor here, it cannot keep at the end.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: It keep zoom back to the it.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Goes back to the top.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I cannot.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, you see, I shrunk down.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: It, keep zoom back to the top.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Can you press command R?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Command R.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, command R, no, it still happen like this.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: No command R.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: You see this is, yeah, it keep move moving.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, like this, I want to check what is the process like this but it keep zoom back.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: It's run back to the top.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: To the top.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I see.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: All right.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Let me ask the team I'll see.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So minus this issue and the quality… decreasing as the token limit gets hit, are there parts that you do like about amp?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Like what are the things that you enjoy about using amp in your workflow?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, you mentioned the commands?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: So I prefer amp compared to the other AI because it's quite lightweight for me.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: When I use this one and terminal together, my laptop still usable compared to the other AI.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: When I use the other AI with angular studio, my laptop frequently got hanged.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I have to restart my laptop, but this one is not observed with the amp so far.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: That is why I prefer to use amp, it's quite lightweight for me if I use the terminal.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: What are the other tools that force you to restart your computer?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Like what are the other AI tools?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Are they?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Can I mention the name?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I'm not sure if I can, no, but I'm using cursor as well.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: If I put cursor at the same time, when I do the task, my laptop got hanged and I have to restart my laptop.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Cool.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Because, I guess what I'm trying to understand is so many grab users love cursor and it's a great product.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, like I can completely understand, but for our customers, there's always… at some of our biggest customers.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: There's always a subset of users who love using amp over cursor.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And they're just getting like so much more output as a result.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And I'm kind of just trying to understand why these, why the rest of the team don't want to work that way because the output, like if you're using it the way like both of you are doing like you've set up all these custom commands you've set up like this entire workflow?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You've got like five instances going at the same time.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So I'm just trying to understand like, why do you think people in your team wouldn't… want to use amp and do things the way you're doing.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Do you have any thoughts a question to both of you?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I think one of the reasons is because we do have some integrations with the cursor, some kind of plugin.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So whenever people roll out something, they will say, oh, it's integrated with cursor.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then people will be like, oh, nice.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Then I can just use the cursor to do stuff for me.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Maybe like what is it called?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: The API integration stuff?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, yeah, in a way, it's already, the ecosystem is already there.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So maybe because of that, it's harder to move to other products.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: That makes sense.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Do you have like an example?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So you mentioned like the API type because… like, for example, you're using amp within VS code, with cursor being a VS code fork?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Is there like a thing that's wouldn't work in VS code that would work in cursor?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Or it is that specific to cursor?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I'm actually not quite sure about that because I don't really use cursor that much, but I think cursor has its own IDE if I remember correctly.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then that's right?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So whenever there is like a tutorial or some kind of stuff or demo, they show you the cursor way of doing stuff.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You're talking specifically internally, right?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah, internally.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah, because I'm working with the, I forgot the name of the team but it's like within the platform engineering team in grab, there's a like AI team that helps people migrate projects and they, a lot of their projects have been done through cursor.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Now we're evaluating doing migrations with amp as well.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So that does sound similar to what they said as well.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I was thinking about that team as well.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Oh, okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Right.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Exactly.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Cool.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Hoang, what about you?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: What are your thoughts?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: For me, I again, the just in my opinion why I use the amp because of the it's lightweight compared to cursor for my laptop, it's an M, this is an apple.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: M.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: So if I open the cursor and android store, and if I use, if I do the heavy task, my laptop will only got.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: M, yeah, the reason why, the most reason why I use amp because of this, is it lightweight for me, it not make my laptop got stuff.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: But one thing is, I feel like cursor is got the better for ides because I can revert the message.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: And this one you mentioned in M, rather how I can use, with terminal.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I don't know, but for cursor with IDE, I can do revert the message.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: But this is what I don't found in the amp terminal.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Let me have a look.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: We don't have the, you can fork a thread but you can't revert back.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'll follow up with the team to see if that's something that's in our pipeline and I'll keep you posted.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: But for the overrun is I feel like I'm faster.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, it quite fast even faster and not consume much memory of my laptop.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, that's.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: fair.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Cool.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: That's to be honest, that wasn't the reason I was expecting to hear.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So I'm glad I met with you both because these are two very different workflows to like just the usual stuff we see.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So it's really good to hear and understand that a bit more.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So pak, is that your first name pak?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Tan, I mean, pak zantan.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then tan, is my surname.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So pak, is that correct?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Pak zantan.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So with your workflow, you're kind of you're focusing on the infrastructure side of things you'll kind of have.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Do you work through Jira tickets or like what's like the source of your work?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Was it like a observability… platform or what do you, where does your work get generated from?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So because… it's a, very big task, so you can say that it generates from maybe like an original idea.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then we change the idea into like a RFC and then based on the RFC after it got approved, then we try to split it down into Jira ticket.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I see.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Okay.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So… there's something I wanted to show both of you.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Hoang, your work comes from Jira as well.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'm assuming right?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: In a way, yes, but I won't say we have a really strict rule of like linking a task to a Jira ticket, because sometimes when we want to do something, we do it and then we create Jira ticket, then we try to link it.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah, after that.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, yeah, in a way, we're using Jira ticket but maybe not in a standard way, yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You're not the first person to tell me that sometimes it's like about logging because the work kind of evolves as you do it.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So it's about kind of logging.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah, that's all good.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Let me show you something.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So last week, we launched… our SDK… the amp SDK and I think it could be helpful for some of the ways that you both work.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Let me share my screen and show you.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So here, I have three terminals and I'm going to execute three scripts, just the same script.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But I'm just referencing one Jira ticket in each.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So this is the same repository but I'll talk through the code in a second, but all it's doing is it's pulling the Jira ticket.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It's referencing the repository creating a branch.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'm using git work trees here.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Do either of you use git work trees already?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah, I can tell you a little bit about it.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So with git work trees, it's a way like the way that branches isolate code into branches, but you can use git work trees to get another level of separation that's at a file system level.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It's a really powerful feature.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And I think from what I'm hearing, it might help you.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So here, I could be working in let's say the dev branch like some feature branch within my VS code, right?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So I'm working on this branch here.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And here I'm in let's… say for… whatever reason, I'm in the main branch here.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So I'm working here.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then in this same solution, I've got three tickets that are being worked on completely isolated.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And what I'm doing here is so you can see here, these are the three tickets I refresh.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You can see they're moved to in progress.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So I'm showing you a solution.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But the thing is you can do whatever you want.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It's like whatever custom workflows and unique systems you need to connect to the things you're doing already.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You can look at automating some of these things by just the cli command like kick off a job that does something.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then if you need to go check in on it later, you can.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So like as you already know, like I've kicked off this job, I can go to this right on my phone or wherever and let's go have a look.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I can see.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay, this is what it's doing already.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I can check in on it.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But ideally the best state obviously, it depends on what you're trying to do is all of these will run it'll, create a PR in I guess in your case, it'll be gitlab, and then I can have a look at that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I can switch branches and keep working there.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But the key, the main thing is, you know, you can't throw everything into this thing.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You need to break things down into smaller chunks that are completable.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I think both of you would already know this, but if you have some simple things that are like, it's a distraction to do that because it's just a small thing.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You've broken it down.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You just need to like punch away and do it really.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You're probably better off like putting that detail in the Jira ticket or wherever you want to have as your source.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then you can put your opinion on like how this should be implemented.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then once this is finished, the way I have it configured, is it'll put a comment in that Jira ticket with the pull request, the amp thread and just a summary of what was implemented.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And if we go, have a look at this pull request, I mean it's still running.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So for the purposes of speed, I'm just going to show you an existing one and… you know, it'll just have like something like this that you can review and then you can continue on with if you want to.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So before I show you the code on how to do this?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Is this of interest to either of you?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: But is this only for in progress?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: It cannot track the other stuff that like done complete or close.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Is it?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You can do whatever you want.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I just wrote 50 lines of code using the SDK just to show you this example of how you can kick off a job.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You could be using it against Jira.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You could be pointing to like a markdown file on your disk.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You can do anything you want.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Let me show you the code first because maybe it's a little bit abstract as to what it's doing.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: If I start doing something then, yes, you can move the Jira ticket into in progress.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: But when my PR, my mr got merged, will you can detect and move the ticket to close or done or complete based on the mr starter because I raised the mr, my team review approved and merged when it merged.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Consider the ticket is closed complete and done, can your amp can detect this one?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I mean, you would need to tap into the webhook event to do that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So if you can, yes, you could do that… but I think it's more or less about like if that's the problem you want to solve, yes, we could probably find a solution to do that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But I think like I saw lots of commands that you were doing already.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Like I think if you have tickets that are like things that you've broken down, that you probably start with a command to initialize the project, initialize the repo start doing these things, you could probably automate some of those already while you're working on another branch.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So to show you what I mean.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So here, I have this execute agent script.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So that's all I was calling in those three terminal windows.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'm just calling this script.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'm referencing the amp SDK and I'm calling this execute method.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And all I'm saying in this part here is based on the Jira ticket.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: What repo to use so can is my Jira board.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It's like a hash map of all the repos to use.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So it could be different for you.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I know you have a big one of repos, so it's probably one repo for you maybe, but where it gets really powerful, is this I'm just calling, I have this prompt which I'll get to in a second and I put it into this execute command and I'm just iterating through those prompts.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Those are the messages you're seeing in the cli output.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then once it's done, it'll just print it there.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And what keeps it all isolated is because I've asked it to clone the repo.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So it's cloned it, put it into this repos folder… fetch the Jira ticket.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And I'm asking it to use a… work tree and branch.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So it'll use git the native git cli command, create a work tree.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then it'll start the work through in that git work tree completely separate to what you're working on now.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So you could think of it as like right now we have this threads feature or you could get conflicts because you're working in that's gonna work in your current branch, right?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So this is a way that you can work on things in complete isolation.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: The reason I use that Jira example is it's just a nice way.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It's like a common workflow that our customers have.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And it's a cool way for me to show you this toolbox feature.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So the toolbox the issue with Jira is that the MCP server only works for Jira cloud at the moment.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And even when you do set it up, you get lots of pop ups for like oauth and things like that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But what you can do is just specify this toolbox path and you can see in this toolbox folder, I have this Jira tool.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So we have this concept in amp of toolboxes where if you wrap particular bits of functionality in these particular methods which I'll show you later in a second, yeah, this execute action and describe action.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So think of like any cli command that you use day to day, if you wanna just wrap that up in a tool, you could do that here.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I've wrapped up hitting the Jira endpoint.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So I'm calling this comment API.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I have another one to like move the ticket, progress, transition, the ticket, it's just using the native API.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So you just need to bring your Jira API key, and then you can use this toolbox tool.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You don't need to have like a custom community MCP server that nobody will trust in the enterprise.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So this is like another feature that we have in amp that you can use.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So you don't need an MCP server for every single thing.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So I guess what I want you to take away from this is less specifically about that Jira workflow but more about automation.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Like I think the people who have your type of workflow are the best people who will get the most mileage out of this SDK and what I'm showing you isn't probably where you're gonna land.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But if you know that this feature exists and how easy it is to just put a command in a prompt in and have it automate in the git work tree.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'm sure you'll just come up with something better than what I can imagine.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Any questions or comments?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: How we set up the org, the token for the user's red ticket.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I mean, how we can, I saw you do the org here, right?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: And how we provide the token or API key for Jira.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, for Jira.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So for in the toolbox in my particular toolbox, I'll give you the code for all of this by the way.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'm just referencing the, I have like a Jira environment variables.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So it's how you can use export variables.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It's running on your local machine.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So it's up to you however you want to run to handle the API keys.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So here it's grabbing these from a config and the config is.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Load Jira, config.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So just grabbing that Jira and file this file here.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: The general idea is this one can help to move the Jira ticket into in preview or in progress.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: And based on what we change in the mr or in the PR, we will push the command into the Jira ticket.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Is it we push the, we push the command into the Jira ticket based on what we change in the gitlab?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It will specifically, what it does is like it will like what my one did was it implemented the feature in the Jira ticket and updated the status in Jira from in progress.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So this was five minutes ago.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It actually implemented the feature… and based on that feature, so this is can three, if I go to can three refresh the page.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It… also updated that to in review.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And all I did to do that is in my prompt, I just said that's… the Jira issue, move it to in progress.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And once it's done like after you do everything and as a part of it, it's like making sure it builds and compiles update it to in review as well.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I know you'll have some complex Bazel some hectic moto reaper problem.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But the key thing is if you're doing that today, this is all running on your local machine.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So just about instructing amp to do what you're already doing.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Let's say if I, but it's based on commit, for example, I raise the mr, then my team might review and they have to do some change.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then I commit.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Again, will they generate the other description or they update the new?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: They'll get, the system will not read the new description for the, into the zero.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So let's say, sorry, go on.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I mean, if I push the new commit to resolve my college command review command, will it write the new one… in the Jira or they update the existing one?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I mean, it's up to you really.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So in that case, let's say like when would you be executing your script?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: If you execute the script, let's say someone left a review, like another example, right?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Let's say you've done a PR, someone left a review, you might, and you're already working on like five other things.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Now you might just start another CI, not CI job, another job.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Or instead of execute agent, it might be like you might have another script called review.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And you just put a link to the mr issue and then just locally, the prompt will say, use the glab, cli, pull the latest comments from that, create a git work tree, propose a solution and implement the fixes and then you can review them before it does uploads it.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, anything manual that you're doing today, just try to think of some ways to automate that.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Okay.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: But we have to run the script manually, right?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: We run the script manually.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: In my example, yes.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But if you have like a webhook or something, yeah, you can do whatever you want.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It's all it's all we have.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'm talking to other customers who are trying to wrap this up in like a node app that they host internally.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then other users can call it for simple like they can from within Jira, they can like say at like the way other people are thinking is like this, they'll have a label called he, amp, and if they put the label amp, and then they move it to in progress, then they'll have a webhook that's listening for these.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then we'll kick off a job and then go through that process I showed you.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But if it doesn't have that label, it'll ignore it.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: The key, the thing we're seeing is that some of these off the shelf tools are popping up but they don't work for everyone.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And realistically, people like your, that have your type of code bases and the skills that you have are better off just building something that works for your exact workflow.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Cause this was what 50 48 lines minus the toolbox, but, you know, like amp does all the heavy lifting with that prompt?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Love you.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I think I'm not sure if it's supported, but maybe it might be good if they can use the tool based on their needs because from what I see here is that we have to pre generate the prompt, right?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So there's no like interactive way to talk to the, to talk with the amp to ask them to perform some kind of fine tuning.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I'm pretty sure there might be a way to do it programmatically but maybe if these come in house then it might be better in?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Your example, are you saying like if I started this and then I'm like, ah, I didn't like where this ended up.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I need to go back open this thread and then work with this in my normal work.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Everything again.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Not not quite.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So like in this workflow.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: What I would do is I have the amp thread.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, and I have the git work tree.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So I just need to open that git work tree which let's see, I'm not sure if there's code oops.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Depending on how you set it up, you'll see the work trees as other branches in here.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So you can right click open work tree and we'll open to that VS code instance to that branch.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then you can continue that thread.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So it will just be a matter of getting that thread id and exactly what Hoang was doing in the, from the id from a website, you can continue that thread with the IDE and then just continue on working through that workflow.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: But that is after everything has been done, right?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: That's after everything's been done.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But like what I'm showing you here, that might not be the best workflow for your use case.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So if you're cause like you're doing like three, four things at a time.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So I feel like if there's something you're doing multiple times like the same thing over and over again, there's probably something you can kick off to maybe get something 80 percent of the way before you even look at it, then you switch to that branch.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Actually from my experience, I interrupt them a lot quite a lot because sometimes when you run halfway, I already know they are going moving in the wrong way.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So I have to, I have to ask them to like you don't do this and then try with other approach.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So I'm thinking if ideally it would be good if, we can attach the tools, into the conversations and then tell them whenever you want.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: You feel like you want to use the tool, then just use the tool then I,\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: it should still be able to do that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Are you running?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You'd have to run it there's a setting that I have like running dangerous on dangerously run all commands or I forgot what it is, cause that will call all the tools that it needs to.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Are you, are you running it like that locally?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Or are you having it approve?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Ask for permission for every step?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I, most of the time, I allow all unless for those critically removing stuff then it requires an explicit allow.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yes.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, I think like from what you've said, it's probably if there's things that need to be fleshed out and you're still guiding the agent, yes, the workflow you're doing is like 100 percent the right way to do it.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But if you have smaller things, you've already broken down and like, ah, that's simple that's almost a distraction to what you're already doing, try find a way that you can throw it off to something and then look at it later.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: That's kind of like the… that's kind of like what I'm trying to propose to you.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah, I think it makes sense for my task right now is more about researching.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, it quite, is a bit a little bit like exploration.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, it might be non standard, but I think this will be, your use case will be useful for like on call tasks.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, people ask questions and I just copy paste and then it generates all the answers for me and then boom, I just reply the user.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: On on call tasks, you also can have it, look through git history, find when something was introduced, kind of give you like a report before you even like as you've gotten out of bed probably.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, that's a cool use case, I think to, explore, on call one.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yep.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Cool.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'll share the code, with you.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: You can, you can, yeah, if you have any questions, you can feel free to ask me.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: There was, just trying to think what else was there?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: They're they're the main things we do have.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: We are working internally with some teams to see if we can get a slack bot stood up so someone can ask a question in slack to say like, hey, like how's this API key used?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Well, like whatever.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then it'll kick off, exactly kind of what you've just seen.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I don't know where that's at, but we're trying to, we're trying to get that stood up.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, we'll see where that ends up, but hopefully, you will see that in slack at some point soon.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Cool.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: So, with the slack bot only for the xero, or it can use for the other context, like, for example, I give them, the code base URL and ask them to do something to do some learning something like that.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Perfect.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Hopefully both, it's, we had a solution that we've been experimenting with, but unfortunately, it didn't work for the grab setup, but now, there's someone else who's trying to build something custom, hopefully using the SDK.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, it's still in progress.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I think at the moment, it will be question answer, but I could very easily evolve into like opening merge requests and things, potentially, I can't really comment cause I'm not building that out, but we've internally, we've seen it built out to creating prs.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Cool.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Well, yeah, any other questions or comments from either of you?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I got another question but not related to the xero, you see, I show you, I try take a few, custom command and I put it into the global config,\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: dunno, you know, anyway, I can create, I can share this global setting with my team, match something like the contest of MCB, something like, yeah, similar to contest MCB, then the people can reuse what I'm writing for the custom command.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Is it possible?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'm glad I was actually going to ask you about that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, cause at the moment, it's only yourself that has those custom commands, no one else, right?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, this is only drafted by me, but I want to share this one for my teammates as well then people can.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah, I believe you should be able to put them into the, folder, within a folder in the repository and it should pick them up.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Would you be comfortable putting it in a repo?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Like cause you, are you working in an android specific part of the repo or is it,\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Into the repo.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yes, for now.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: But if, yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Alternatively, you could have there you go.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, but any way that we can put somewhere else then people?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I think another option is,, you could have another repo that's just full of commands and then, people can pull them into their, into their own, and commands folder, and it'll just be available, on all, on all projects.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, I think if it's something beneficial to that repo specifically, it's good to put it in that repo, because every, everyone will benefit from it.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: But if you're worried about, you're going to get approved and these sorts of things, then the best way is just to share those and have other people put it directly into their, the folder, same the same way you have, cause they become personal commands.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then… cool.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, but I think that, I want to have something like, similar… to MCP.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Somehow, I do some MC, I probably want MCP then, my teammates only need to install it, need to set up the MCP.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then they can use because I don't want to put into my current project, then wherever I change, then I need to, got approval preview something like that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah, cause if, like, would you, what about if you had another repo, like just for your configuration that you share with your team?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Then what they do, they have to pull and push them into the global config, is it?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah, they'll put it into their, think of it as just if you have a grab amp, commands repo, and then you have a folder for the amp, the android team, and then you have all the best android commands in there.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Park, san, might have commands for his team.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then as people, update them or add more to them, you can just pull, refresh them that way.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It's not an ideal solution, but that's I'm just trying to think of, what could, what could get you there?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, but notice, if I push something change, I ask, I have to ask them to pull, to get the new one, right?\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: If, if, do this approach.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah, yeah, cause, it's not anything we manage centrally on a server, like on an amp profile or anything like that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It's gotta be on a file system somewhere and get the best way to do it.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And if you don't want to do it in the project repo, you could start a separate repo, that has these commands.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Okay.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Got it.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah, thank you.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: I think about this because I want to, somehow, to share the custom command to my team.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Let me ask the team as well.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I'll see if anyone's come across any creative solutions, I'll let you know if I hear anything better.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Okay.\nSpeaker 2748094143035115425: Thank you.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Cool.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Well, yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, nice to talk to you both.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And, yeah, really appreciate your time.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: We'll I'll share the repo, in slack, and then you can ask me if you have any questions?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So I have one question, maybe kind of like a feature request.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, I think, the command run by the amp is, doesn't have a state, right?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, as in like a bash command?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: The bash command.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, so I'm thinking whether it's possible to maybe, have a terminal that records all the state.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Otherwise, eventually, the command will be pretty long because sometimes I need to maybe export some variables, but it can't do that.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, what it does is that every request it will export, it will always add the export variables inside.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then sometimes we have multiple variables.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then it gets pretty long.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, yeah, I'm not sure whether you can work on that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, is the issue, so, is the issue that it doesn't I didn't follow, the amp issue there?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Ah, is that because every, every request is running on a new terminal environment?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Oh, and then it doesn't have the environment variable set when it's running that bash command.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay, there is a, there is a good solution for that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: It is a bit of a workaround but it works really well is, if you use tmux sessions and you just ask amp to spin up a tmux session, and then, it has access to, send keys, read error, messages, read the logs.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Have you, have you experimented with that before?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: You mean kind of like an SSH, into a terminal?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, if, so, for example, let me try to show you real quick.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, if I go to, let me find the right repo… so not this one… not this one.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I think it's here.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So here, so right now, I'm, running in the client npn run dev as an example.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I could just ask, amp, start a tmux session called, let's call it grab test, amp, for example, run, from… the client folder, npn run dev.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And on the right, and… I'll say create three paint.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, tmux, there's a specific syntax which I am not fluent in.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, this is like a great way to get started with tmux.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, here, it's creating a new tmux session.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And all it is, tmux is like a terminal multiplexer.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, even when you close the, the terminal window, that session is still running, but you can see here, it's gone, it's sending keys.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, if there's a, an error or a console error within that terminal session, you can just say, hey, look at the left, window in this session, and fix that error as an example.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, here to run this, I just need to type in this command.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, if I go, and start a new terminal paste that in, we can see here, it's got the clients.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Did it run it… npn run dev?\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So, here, it's running here.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And I could say, I could ask questions about that tmux session and it knows, so that session's always running.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And, that way, once that's set up, you don't need to resend and initialize it with the export keys and things like that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Would that help your workflow?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So it doesn't mean that for any following commands, it, the M, will attempt to connect, to the tmux and then runs there.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: If, not for everything, you just need, you need to tell it, like if you're running a server and that server is going to run, spend multiple threads, you're better off running that outside of amp and telling it to use a tmux session.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: And then for other things like calling a cli locally, it'll still use bash for that.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Okay.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: So that's something I would recommend, experimenting with, to see if that helps.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: I think that's a good idea.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah, cause sometimes, sometimes, right now, when I try to run something, it doesn't know that every command is in the, is run in the new terminal.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: So, sometimes if I try, it will say, oh, let me try to export after export.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: It generates another terminal say, hey, how come, how come this variable doesn't exist?\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Let me export again.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: And then, yeah, sometimes it happens that.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Sounds frustrating.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I think this will help if it doesn't help, let me know, and I'll see if there's any other solutions.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Cool.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Awesome.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: I think we're just that time, so, yeah, it was great chatting to you, chatting to you both.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Yeah, maybe if there's some big developments, I'll let you know again and we're connected on slack so we can chat there as well.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Sure.\nSpeaker 4232566879553905964: Thank you.\nSpeaker 7405155190492689762: Thank you bye.",

however, he did not accept this invite.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, let's see.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I got the impression that I'm… sorry, I can't recall if you were copied on those emails earlier this week, but I got the impression that he wasn't… quite there but was optimistic with being ready in the near future as he just suggested a few days delay in our chat.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: At least that's what I'm hoping for.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And I mean, fair point getting that plex team up and running and everything like that.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I'm sure there's some, oh, he just accepted.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Fairly straightforward.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I'm going to stand simply.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: This is like a trial planning session, but, you know, let's see where they're at in terms of updates from him and go from there.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: That was good.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Cool.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I'll drop in a copy of the running notes as well, if you don't have it handy.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Hey, Brian.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Hi, I'm Malcolm.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: How are you doing?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, doing well.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: How are you?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: It's.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: been a whirlwind of what else?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Should I say?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: A tornado over here?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Oh, yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Geez a tornado outside the usual tornado or no?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: No, it's the usual tornado right now because of all the changes in layoffs we're still going through unfortunately.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Well.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So let me give you guys progress.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So I filled in the team and our leadership about what you guys want to engage.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And then I, which means I have to get lawyers involved and I got lawyers involved because ultimately, what I think, what I want, I think what I remember what we talked about is it'd be nice to say, hey on your website, we're working in intel and we're going to do this whole thing because if you're going to give us so much credits, you're buying something.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And so in order to do that like, we don't mind, but I want you to have that ability to be able to say, hey, we're working with intel and put it on your website sort of stuff.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So I have that going.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Our internal team is we lost three guys.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I'm hiring three more guys because they got cpm'd so I'm frantically working with.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So I'm trying to give us a five person team.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I know Nick has because Nick's trying to help me.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: It's him and I, we're the architects and we're trying to get a three to four Guy team.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So that turns us into Nick, us two and then three or four.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So we might be getting five guys on.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And so my timelines have been pushed out a little bit.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I used, I don't know if, you know, I used a little bit of stuff.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I had it help me write up some MVP stuff to kind of get our leadership to go.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Hey, we need these people here's.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Why, yada.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yada.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And so right now, the answer is, yeah, we appreciate.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: We want to do this with you.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I have two parallel streams going on.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Does that make sense?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: That makes sense?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And appreciate the updates and those three to five guys that's the flex team that you were talking about in our last call, correct?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And they got fired, you heard that, right?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: You don't know.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Jeez.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Okay.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So they.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: bad choice of words.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: We don't use that word.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: This was the team that went to, so they were with intel, they went to accenture and then did they get fired again from the accenture apologies?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So what happened is even though 300 folks, the whole flex group got pushed there's contracts associated because the way it works is flex we hire internally, it's our own internal contingent worker program.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: If you will, they all had about 300 people had a statement… of works associated with their contracts.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Well, what happened is in our industry, in our group, all the contracts got cut.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah, gotcha.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: If there weren't already a signed contract, they didn't get renewed.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So what happened, which was a surprise and that was as of like last Thursday or no, well, a week before that, it was Thursday before that.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Okay, the point I'm trying to get you is now we have to go find our internal blue people and we've been talking about rehiring one of those guys that's why I say it's tornado.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I'm okay with you guys saying maybe intel's not the right player to do this.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I'm fine with that.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Really what I want to get to a place, is, this is the ideal outcome.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I want to get to a spot where you can see how much money we're spending and so that we come up with a monthly billable or annual billable strategy within our development program inside our government technologies.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I would love to see this take to the bigger part of intel.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I've already approached our it folks higher up.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: They're interested.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I said, okay, I'm pushing on them and I want to introduce you to them.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: They wanted me to give them feedback, but I've been kind of playing mixed field here.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: When I give them my feedback.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I'm giving my feedback as a personal user, but I'll let them know that way, right?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Right, right.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I'm giving them a feedback from over here.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Now, I got to tell you amp, yesterday or the day before helped me find an amazing problem in a piece of code from the staff that left.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And, you know, my virtual assistant and I went down the road figuring out what to do is effing phenomenal.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: That's great to hear.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: You know, I have guys that are going using like copilot agent and I know that that's kind of doing the same thing as amp, but I still, every time I use some of these things, you know, you already hit grok's LLM, or I still say, you know, amp, gets me closer than those other products.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I don't know if that's your guys' experience.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I mean, I don't know.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: How to opt that's exactly the goal.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yes, yes, you.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Guys, I'm assuming you every once in a while check their products out, yes.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: No.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, yeah, of course.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And, even with grok specifically, we've been experimenting backing in some of their models to use them for specific tasks in amp.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, you know, it's kind of all everything in terms of how the amp product evolves, everything is on the table.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: You know, very much taking an experimental approach, how we can, how we can make it the best, you know.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I'll tell you guys both that, you know, I might be leading the witness because I want to ask your opinion, but I'll just say, you know, a number of I'm now calling these things virtual assistants really because I hate using the word AI.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Okay?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And some of the models and some of these models want you to pay more, blah, blah, blah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I get it because they're trying to tell you what you want to hear.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But for me, my best virtual assistants is amp from a development point of view.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And then I find that grok gives me the most.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I don't know.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I don't know what you guys are finding, but I feel like grok is it's I don't know how to describe it.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I tried him and I've tried a whole bunch and I still try just to see.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And anyway, is that what you guys find or you find other blends?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Now?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Grok, I don't use mainly as a developer.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I'm just saying as.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Other reasons.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Just like personally and, you know, when you need, the LLM for whatever it might be.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, I'm keen to hear Jacqui's opinion on this.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: What I can say is we've certainly heard more about it internally as peaking a lot of the key amp development team's interest in terms of, you know, things it can do.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I'm for most of my personal stuff.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I'm currently still on like the gpt V and a little sonnet iv V.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Okay.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, Jacqui keen to hear what you.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Yeah.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: To be honest, I haven't tried grok or like I haven't been using grok in my day to day.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: We have like an internal team that is dedicated for evaluating models and they're the ones that literally try every new model that comes out that's awesome.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Yeah, I don't have the time for that, but, I do, I go back and forth between openai and cloud.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Oh, yes.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: You know, like I'll go to openai, because I still think chaigbt gbt V does a really great job of like more planning type stuff.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Yeah.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: And I like to, you know, think with it more and then cloud I still think is way better for coding and tool calling.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I find with chaigbt, I always have to say, please tell me the truth.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Playing them off each other, you know, having them kind of go back and forth and that's the experience in amp, right now, you can kind of they'll check each other's work almost, you know.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, right now, on my own personal projects, I'm actually doing it, I'm training a model and do.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Some inferencing, oh, nice.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: A specific particular thing and I asked amp and grok to kind of help me get started on certain things and I was so impressed with the convergence, right?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: You know what I?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Mean?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Sure.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And what about the other piece?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Have you guys been coming up?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Because, you know, I hear a lot of lawyers talking about intellectual property that you can't use AI and then it throws it all out.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Do you come across that at all in your?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: We actually have with another customer.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: We were just going through some discussions around, you know, what the state of intellectual property rights, indemnification, and all of this kind of works when you're going for, you know, like if you think about it like hody for example, was a material different product from something like amp because it was, you know, like contained in the context of your code almost whereas you can go to amp and tell it to build anything.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And the problem, that then creates is I can go, hey build me Dropbox.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And if I'm you know, someone on your flux development team and say build me Dropbox and that comes in under like intel and Dropbox finds out about that.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: You know, there's a whole different cascading like… chain of liability if you will.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So yeah, definitely some like that's cool.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: The interesting thing I'll say is that like it's evolving thinking across the different stakeholders in this, you know, kind of in this realm, right?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, whereas I think a lot of security and legal teams used to have the final say in this, a lot of companies are realizing that these are different tools and it is very important to get them up and running in their environment, you know?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: That being said, I have, I don't know if you thought of this, it might be hopefully it might be an opportunity for you guys.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So what I asked this particular lawyer, I said what if I had my own LLM that I trained and created… I have my own AI interface and it's running in my closed environment.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I ask it to assist me in all that stuff.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: At what point?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Does this area where everything is I own from the beginning?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And there's intellectual property and your IP and your copyright that you're creating.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And you're using a virtual assistance that originated from your own company.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Where does that end?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And he goes, his first question is you can run this on your own and I'm like I have no money, you can run power and you can.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: One of the opioids or something.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And he's like, so I said, this is, he goes that's a twist.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I'm not sure our firm has even thought about it because again, what I've tried to get at is like if you, I'm very keen where I'm trying to get to is I hope one day your product is in such a way that we could do a closed loop network that we license out so that we can work on top secret product that's.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: what I'm trying to get at, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: The other advantage I'm trying to establish is from a legal point of view by doing this and because things in your closed loop are not being shared and you're using this brain to help you facilitate and not create things from scratch but assist in things, what area does that mean?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: It's not, why would that not be still your copyright, your intellectual property et cetera.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: That's what I'm trying to prove a point anyway.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And there's a really interesting like chain of like what would have to happen to even like prove that it was some sort of infringement?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: You know, like, so obviously, you'd have to be able to track back to the individual person who prompted the LLM to do something malicious, right?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And then that code even if it was, you know, like because I can build in the Dropbox example, a file sharing app.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: What makes it materially the same as Dropbox, right?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Like, and in order to know that I'd have to know their code therefore, and then you have the whole step about like does Dropbox ever even find out and press charges?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: You know?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So it's like this whole thing of like decreasing probability, you know?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And then.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: The other thing I said, look at, I wrote a bunch of code and I used an agentic AI and it learns my pattern and again, virtually assists me.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But I'm the originator and that you can see the pattern.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: It originates off what I started with.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So at what point would you even know that?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I did it exactly, yeah, like.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And that is the well, you know, probably in a lot of cases, the 1,000,000,000 dollar question right there, right?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Like.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And then I got him thinking because he was in the place of the original copilot model where, you know, copilot's looking at GitHub for all of its learning methods, right?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And obviously, when you start early on, you could see like pattern chunks coming out like that looks like existing code, nothing to look like a previous pattern that I wrote, right?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And that's why I didn't like it.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I was like, this doesn't feel like the way I would write something amp for me is the first time, you know, I had written thousands, you know, multiple books and novels out of the code I've written, right?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And you see it like replicating your style like, you know, jaw drop going holy, shnikes.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: That pattern recognition, right?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: That was a bit of a tangent, but literally, I want you to realize I'm trying all these angles.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Sure.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Because we had our internal lawyers coming back and saying, and I'm saying, look, this is a situation, you know, at what point do you go?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: This tool VS code I'm using isn't an assistant that you were saying?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Oh, because we use VS code to do our work, this tool.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Now, we can't copyright it.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I mean, how do you know that?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I haven't thought of something and I wrote it down and I said, hey, help me finish these things like the fact that I can tell it to go rename something, you know, a 1,000 points just because I asked it that virtual assistant.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And instead of me spending the dollars and time to go rename this, find string grip, said replace like, come on.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Come on.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Right.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: No, no, I hear it.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: No.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: But to that point, you said a couple of things that I had a few follow up.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Questions.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Sorry about the tangent.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: No, no, you're fine.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: You're fine.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, it sounds like the last time we had spoke, you were just going to get Nick up to speed.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: It sounds like all good, Nick's on board and everything like that.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Any questions?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Or anything we can help with?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Nick is on board.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: He wants to go deeper with, he wants to exercise and he hasn't had the time, but I've been sharing screens with him.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Okay?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And so far, I've been hearing like, wow, this is pretty dang good.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: That's what I.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Hear.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, awesome.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I know he signed up and has an account and we're under the same team right now.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Okay.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I saw something.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I saw his name flash through in one of our internal.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But I don't know if he's actually exercised… it without seeing it on my screen or asked it and popped it.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah, I don't know yet.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Gotcha.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Okay.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Cool.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: But.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Go ahead.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: No, no, no, please, yeah, finish the thought, but I was.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I wanted to be very clear and open with you because you credited us some stuff mal in there, I have no idea.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I don't remember.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah, I wanted to make sure you're aware I wasn't taking advantage of that, but I did, no, no, that's what it's there for, you get to do a few things to help me solve, you know, trying to get them to go.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Okay.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: This is amazing.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: No, no, that's exactly what the credits were designed for.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: One thing I want to tell you on Tuesday, it helped me solve something that would take me all week because of what was I going to tell you?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: The team leaving?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And, you know, I don't have muscle memory because I haven't been writing their code, right?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I know I can go find string, go figure out where it all is.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I said, hey, I need to find this.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And all of a sudden it goes line 32, blah blah blah here it is click open.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And then I said, here's my situation… and, but I think it's going on in here and he goes, oh yeah, yeah, you're absolutely.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I love the confirmation bias.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Wonderful being… I know, but anyway, but the one thing we sleuthed out together is one of our models, we were, we had to have flying objects that use, you know, GPS, but our model was based on a perfect world sphere and we realized, oh, and I said, oh crap, the world's not a perfect sphere.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: It's an ellipsoid.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And then I had to go down the path of figuring out how GPS does it.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And, you know, my virtual assistant and I go, the part that it helped me a ton was the trigonometry because I forgot all my sokotoa.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So kind of, you know, anyway.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: That's.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: crazy.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: It was awesome.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I was like man, the amount of time it saved me is just amazing.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, of course, I go and repeat the story and I said, but we still need guys.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, but between.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: You and I, that virtual assistant basically replaced the three guys.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Honestly.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Do you hear what I'm saying?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So what I, my goal is still convince leadership, we still need more team, but I want to, I want to pair them because I really feel if you have a great architect, yes, virtual assistant, you're worth three people?\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Yes.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Well, that's exactly it because, you know, we feel the same exact way like you still need an architect, a captain of the ship if you will.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: But now, you have like, you know, a fleet of agents that can do work for you but you still have to have somebody that understands code, knows what good code looks like and can, you know, orchestrate it and architect everything.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: So you're thinking about that absolutely correct.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: We don't we don't think that AI is quite there yet where it can like truly replace you.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Know people.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And my problem, is it comes down to that garbage in garbage out.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I think I use it.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yes, if I have a junior dev, I… think it's going to be a hindrance to the outcome of what we want around intellectual property or copyright to be honest, because it's I think just in my mind, don't have that mindset and they're going to rely on some more back to the same thing you said to build me a Dropbox type environment.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I think they're going to be a lot high and that's the problem I need.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So right now, I am, I'm pulling back this training program that I have started.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And the Guy I was report, we're going to tell he moved out of the group.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: He actually, you may be moving out of the company, but that, that's where.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So I said it was actually a good thing because I started realizing that we need to have this architecture architect type mindset paired with the virtual system.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But also through training and attrition of new people coming on, how do you help a junior dev grow into that architect person?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And so that's currently a kind of a project I'm working on to write up this sort of overview.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: As as we bring in developers into our organization.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: How do we go through a process of molding them into this style?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: That's all I'm trying to get to.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Yeah, no, it's you're thinking about this the right way and I think this is like, a new problem, you know, like,\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: we've.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: never been in this situation before, but yeah, it's I think you're so, right?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I, right now, like, the devs that we had that were at our flex team, some of the folks would call them senior developers.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I, I'm a little bit harder.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I would call them developers.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: We had one junior dev and a developers, but they were paid at a senior developer.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I gotta be honest with you that's all relative to intel's software development.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Intel's, not a software company.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, that's why I say it like that.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: They excelled at, you know, where they were versus others.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: However, you know, if I paired them with the agent, you know, amp, I think they would be, do a good job, but I would need to spend some more time coaching on how to describe their things and hold up those classes with them, in some of the things I've learned and how you just say, my biggest concern is always this.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I don't want the virtual assistants to create things from scratch because then the person doesn't learn anything and they don't know really how to read back and understand, I, I'm trying to create, a, you know, cascading effect, a waterfall effect.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I don't wanna program that like, I don't mean that in an agile version, a lot of it.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But what I'm trying to say is this is how that architecture versus have to work together.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: This is how a senior developer, and I almost wanna say junior developers, you know, you're only allowed to, you know, do this much and I don't even know if I can, I bet you, I could ask, you know, say, hey, this user who logs into this only limit to this type of urban?\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But anyway, you get what I'm getting at, right?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I'm, trying to… okay, so that's what I'm trying to put together, as a white paper, slash actual program for within and inside intel.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Just so you know, as well, for the trial, I know that's going to be a smaller crew, but, we will also offer enablement.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: And if you do at least purchase, the five K, minimum, then we'll offer more enablement as well as people on board.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: So just examples of like workshops that we could present or potentially do would be, agents MD file, how do you make sure that you have good agents MD file?\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: You know, like context engineering and MCP tool calling, you know, prompting like it's really honestly, whatever appeals to you guys the most, but we have like, yeah, different workshops that we can offer.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Well.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: That'd be amazing.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: We'll pair it with that.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, I'll keep that in mind.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, as a terms of timeline and where we execute getting, you know, a five K monthly or more, based on our current trajectory of certain things, you know, it would be nice to say we could sign something by Christmas, right?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And then, you know, the end of the year with signing up until let's just shoot for that as an, a goal, but be real, I want you to be realistic.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I don't know what I don't know, but I bet you the new year would be, I'm pretty confident first quarter, we'll probably get some of that.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I'm just telling you how the domino effects and how much tornadoes is going on.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, what I want you to hear, is, I want this, my, cohort architect is a senior PD, wants to include this, I'm projecting that we need this as a way to save money, with people who hold the purse, they like that, I'm, I'm now getting the lawyers and I've already got the lawyers of all, I want the lawyers involved so that you guys can actually use our name, to say an announcement of say, hey, also used by so, and so company on your website?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah,\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I just want to make sure, did I misread though you, the whole, what you're let me step back was that your intent about doing this program is to say, announce that or not?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Did I misunderstand?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, it's always something we're, interested in, yeah, whatever we can,\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: If we can't do, it doesn't hold you back.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Is what you're saying?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Exactly, exactly.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: More importantly, you want to basically secure a monthly or annual basis with us at minimum, would be the ideal scenario.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Our, our ideal even right now is to, get you stood up with amp, even if it's at a, our minimum threshold is five K and that's not monthly that's just five K credits, you know, so basically getting, reading between the lines, sort of long story short here, we are confident that once people start to use, amp, like you have yourself that, it kind of grows naturally.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, our main goal is to be able to, enable that.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And obviously, within a company like intel, there, there's going to be the legal paperwork.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: There's.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Going to be the budgetary signups and stuff like that.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, getting through those hurdles is sort of, our,\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: focus, we'll take this as a parallel point because I think I made up something in your requirements and not realizing that's what you know, I meant.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, I'm glad I said that parallel effect, piece.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: We'll get the legal stuff going just so.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And if they say no, fine, it has happened by the way that's why I'm bringing it up.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: The other side, is let's get to that place where we contractually get the place where intel's paying you guys sound good?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, that sounds good.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Okay.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, and given those tweaks is, does the Christmas kind of goals still sound about right?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Or?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So that's why I wanted to add on, I don't think the lawyer side where you can announce something is by Christmas.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: No, that's fine.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, that's fine.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I figured as.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: much that the money, having greenbacks is more important as a company than, you know, but, I didn't want to add that as your requirement for the, I don't you guys mentioned, you know, I don't care if the number has changed, but for me, I always felt like, wow, that's very generous to offer.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: We got to give you more back, right?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: In some way.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And that's why I think I brought up the idea of at least announcing something marketing wise, but, I may have what I'm trying to reiterate is I may have created that stipulation and you guys didn't okay.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: That's all I'm.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: trying to say, no, no, that's yeah, yeah, no, it's I mean, we love logo rights.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Don't get me wrong, especially if it's something like intel, but, but yes, just to, from our perspective, it is not like, a requirement of that unlimited trial.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: The only thing that I will say about the unlimited trial and obviously, you know, we can denigle this and work around with it a little bit is, from our leadership's perspective, the, one of the big drivers of being so generous is to try to incite velocity with it.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So they basically look to set up those trials, and ask for a decision shortly after.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Now, appreciating that there's yeah, you know, there's parts here.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Intel is not, you know, an SMB company or something like that.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: That is, that is, you know, we're talking directly to the CEO or something.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So the only thing I would say and it sounds like with, you know, getting these other three to five people in, is we'll probably just want to think a little bit about when it would make sense to enable that unlimited trial.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And I know last time we had talked about mid October, maybe that's more like, you know, mid November or something like that and.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: You know, we might win the deal just from Nick and I, by the way.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And that's you know, that is so that, the credits that we've given you right now, use those to your heart's content, you know, and if that's what?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I want to.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Hear.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I don't want to wait for, let's just make this sign of like not parallel with trial.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: What I… mean, is I don't want to stop and let you guys wait.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Like if you wanted to do this whole, multi person, great, we'll try that.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I don't want that.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I would, if we could win with just Nick and I fantastic.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I'm.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: going to push, I'm, going to push, okay, regardless of whatever it can.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Awesome.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Does that sound good?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: That sounds perfect.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: What can we do in terms of, you know, like, I, if I'm not mistaken.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I shared some of our AI terms.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Do we, I can, draft up a, like an order form, what that would look like so we can get some red lines going back.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Why not?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Why don't we do that?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So here's… what I want to feel comfortable from a moral point of view, because I like the whole give and take.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I was sort of putting things, not trying to hit it hard because I wanted you guys to feel like you were getting in something, but I'm just going to repeat, is it okay if Nick and I hit it hard with some real development?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And then we could use that as fuel to say, look, this is what we were able to accomplish.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And without this, we weren't able to do it.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I did it on Tuesday, but if I can have a secondary cheerleader like go use this, go do.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: This, yep.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yep.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I don't want anything to hold us back is what I'm saying and I want you to feel comfortable and I want to feel comfortable that I'm, getting permission to go and do this because you guys gave us credits.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I mean, it's been spending money.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: You go with that.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: No, that sounds great.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And, you know, like I think the, I think the fact that this is real work, you know, is real work, real proof points, real use cases, et cetera.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Something tangible to show, is like music to our ears kind of, you know, we find that, these work a lot better when we can, you know, pan, real business value back to whoever signed that check, you know?\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: And just to be clear, like it's just time boxed.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: So, I'll like you have some credits now that you can still mess around with.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: But if you want to hit it hard, just tell me when you want that start date to happen, and I can load your workspace with like that's what we're allowed to do, of credits and then hit as hard as you can for two weeks and then I have to zero you guys out.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Yeah?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Understood.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Okay.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Here's, what I want to do is I'll make a I'm going to let Nick know, let's kind of get moving forward and not really wait for, hiring the folks.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And then maybe we can hit it hard with the credits we have now.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So you don't even have.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: to give us more.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And then if it becomes the place where I'll send you guys a name.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Hey, we want to continue hitting it hard.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: We haven't hired anyone.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Let's just hit this program right now and then we'll elevate and show the results and let's just attempt to do with what we have.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Now.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: How about that?\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: That sounds good?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And then, you know, obviously, as things evolve and stuff like that, where, you know, this is exactly how we want these relationships to go, right?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, you know, let's chat about it.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Let's let's keep the lines of communication open, whatever we can do to facilitate that.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: You've got, it looks like the full 25,000 credits at the moment remaining.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, yeah, that's those are, go to town.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I was just holding back but I'll just say, go do it.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Okay.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Cool.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Is there, do you guys give, pricing wise if you buy more credits?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Is there like bulk pricing or better pricing if you buy more?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Okay.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yep.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, we, we start at discounts at around, 25,000 annual commit.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And then, you know, once you get up into, into the kind of like three to 400,000 dollar range, those, that's when you start getting into like, the more significant sort of things, but it's a table.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: It's it's a fixed thing.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I can share that with you that's no problem.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Okay.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And generally, you know, I'm, asking for two reasons.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Okay, personal side, yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And then this, yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, and then, yeah, right.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Hey, if the nova eight stuff, if, if you want to do something over there too, that's a problem as well?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Well?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: No, no, no.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I meant, in terms of the, you know, yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah, I don't even think I'm, I, you know, I think I spent over a 1,000 or whatever, but, I'm wondering what it, what those breaking points like shoot?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I just buy a bulk section if there's a good brand, I might spend five grand just over there, just right?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Right.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, that's, yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, all of that, all of that stuff is like, and one of the reasons why, we, you know, kind of focus on, that five K starting point is one, a lot of companies don't really know how to use some of this stuff, and, you know, us enabling a smaller investment, you know, sort of tipping towing into it.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Has proven to be helpful.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: But the other thing is, that gives us a bat in concert with, you know, the credits we've already given you if an unlimited trial makes sense, gives us a very good understanding of like what the usage proof points are in a given day.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So we can go and say, hey, this is a like a real con, contextual estimate of what we think your developers are going to use over time and therefore, where we would recommend starting in terms of like a larger commitment to unlock those discounts.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: So, it's all sort of like, it's intentional to enable the realities of the situation with agentic tools and, to make sure that it's you know, like, the one thing we don't want to do is say, hey, you're enabling 400 people with this, we need 400 licenses.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: We don't know how much they're going to use them, but we're going to charge you 100 bucks a month for those licenses.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: You know, so we're kind of like the anti, that, which is, it has driven a lot of decisions around how we, you know, one structure, our pricing for this, in the consumption basis and to, you know, how we're approaching starting this growing and partnering with, with people going down this pathway with us?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And throw a curve ball.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I see we're seven minutes over.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I can go over a little more.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Are you guys?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Good or no?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Oh yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Jeez.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, yeah, I'm good.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, thank you.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I… don't know in my group, what we do a lot of stuff is for edge and battery operated devices, whether they're mobile or on the ground or wearable.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But we are exploring right now and twofold things is a small, you know, micro, you know, llms that were micro, devices, and we have sort of scenarios where we're asking querying questions on machines that are using nine watts, right?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And, you know, the responses aren't, are good enough and what it's doing.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But I don't know that you, this might not even be part of your business strategy, but I'm throwing it out there because there's a lot of things we do that even from, a person that may require some quick code fix in field.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I want to throw this out there because I, we, I mean, we have new technology that we're working on where you're doing a massive amount of compute in a half watt.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I know that sounds amazing.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Crazy, but we were doing object detection models that were able to identify and replace certain things they saw in the scenery in a matter of seconds on a half a watt.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Okay.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, there's opportunity here.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: If you don't go this way, I know, I'm not, I'm just throwing it out there that there could be more of a joint white paper ever because the genetic stuff that I've been seeing there's two things going on object detection, doing something.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And then there are scenarios where actually code has to be fixed in the field in a very situation, very quick situation.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And in my mind, I think there needs to be a couple brains if you will virtual assistants within the system to be able to do that.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And, we're testing out all the image detection stuff.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But I'm like imagine you have somebody sitting there and working on a fuel line that they see that there's a software problem, but it's a light threatening situation.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I have a mobile device I've got, you know, roughly, you know, to be able to do something.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: The tops isn't amazing.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But it's good enough.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I asked it the question to look at my software, what can you help me patch or do?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And it does it in the background?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And so, I don't know what sizes you guys are at, but this is this I'm currently working on this.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And the second thing I'm working on is a horizontal scalable architecture that in proximity to other devices, your tops increases.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, imagine being able to spread, we've successfully been able to, split tasks or, over multiple small edge devices for a single request to increase the tops, like we have a shim layer to do that, and spread your LLM processes through machines and yada.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yada.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, I'm just throwing ideas at you guys.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Well.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Actually, we're, we're already working on background agents.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: We're actually really close to like making it more widely available for people to try.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: But, yeah, like where, we're experimenting right now with like remote background agents that like you could from your cell phone, open an amp session, and tell it to do something and it would remotely use like one of our servers to actually execute the tax and come back to you with an answer.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Beautiful, which is one thing I forgot to add.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: In all that scenario, they're disconnected from the interwebs.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: What I just, oh, okay.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Gotcha.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, it's like all of that I just described on all that energy and walk and detection and LLM all happened.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Disconnected.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Wow, that is a harder thing.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: For that.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah, yeah, I know, and I'm throwing it out there because we, this is what we call D deal like a disconnected disaggregated, it's a type of term, right?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Or basically on premise.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But the important part I want you to hear we still did the level of detection in that, you know, agnostic, you know, agentic AI stuff on a half a lot.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: That's impressive.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And then, you know, around, you're starting to get really good response time.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yes, it's not as fast as if you were connected to, in the server room, but it's good enough in these scenarios.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Okay?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But the agentic AI has been the most promising in our test cases.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And that's why I've said there's two things here.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Imagine where you say so and so come stand next to me so I can make this decision happen faster and so, or a group of drones that are in flight, you send more.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And so I really wanted you to hear this.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I forgot to say it's all disconnected.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: The asian idea is a great idea.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Please go down that road.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And all I'm seeding you guys with is it's an opportunity not asking to change your business model, you probably need to get revenue based on what you're building.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But if there's something in mind and you come back and you brainstorm and I know for sure there's joint effort contracts with multiple companies.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yada, yada, just another avenue that, you know, we're doing proving points right now that this is possible with certain, you know, I know I've seen llms, but I keep, you know, is it small or micro?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I'm now trying to change them where, you know, some of the footprints are like 800 megabytes which is pretty dang small for, you know.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But I'm not trying to tell you to change.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But what I'm trying to tell you, I hope you my rambling here is there is the, I still say, you know, from the breadth that I've been using your agentic AI processing is the best.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And if we can extract in certain situations some mechanism to repair Bam, right?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And this happened by the way, this is a real use case that I used on Tuesday to demonstrate how I can modify a problem of communication of positioning with the drone and how I said, I need you to prepare this, what happened and it made a small patch to fix it to act like.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I don't know what it's going on.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I said this is my symptom help me figure out what's going on and it says here's the patch, would you like me to look?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, imagine an operator being able to do that in field?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: That's what I'm trying to get at?\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Yeah, no, got it.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So if there is at all interest, I mean, there's right now, there's a 908,000,000,000 dollar wow.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Well, I was going to say Brian, we have field engineers and four deployed engineers and if the price is right, we'll make anything happen.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Okay.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So this is all interest, please take it back.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Let's go back because right now, I'm doing demos, my colleague is doing demos with the part of hey, the small little handheld device.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I mean, teeny, it runs forever.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: It just looks over here and it says what type of craft is this?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And it'll come back and tell you this or it looks at an infrared thing.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Just all these things.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And part of this controls different flying things.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I got to be careful.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, what I'm trying to say is there was a situation where we had a flying thing in negative space and it halted in flight, like where am?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I, and then now I virtually took back the problem and symptoms in my virtual area.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I said, okay, I'm an operator here's, my AI, my input interface.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I tried to act like somebody here's.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: What I'm seeing going.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Can you figure out what's going on and boom.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Wow.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Like, you see where I'm going with this?\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: So, in field fixing problems, because there's going to be software problems all the time, right?\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Okay.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Enough.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Said, if it is all interest on this too, please come back, cool.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: You know, these are real world scenarios going on right now that we are trying to solve using virtual assistants on handheld wearables, anything you can imagine, and we're trying to make our software, our hardware fast enough good enough to do the job.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: But the power, you know, envelope low.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Okay?\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Cool.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Yeah, yeah, no, that's we appreciate the insight.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Cool.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: All right.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Thanks for your time.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Awesome.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Thanks for everything.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: We'll keep in touch.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, I will, you know, let us know what we can do, how we can help start going to town on those credits.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: I will get that order form ready.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: We have a very capable and friendly team legal counsel who's happy to hop on calls and stuff like that.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: You know, if, we need to get the lawyers talking or anything like that just to get this initial over the line.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And yeah, we'll just keep in touch go from there, you know, we can have these chats as they make sense over the next couple of weeks here and see what we can get together with the initial.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: And then obviously, we'll grow from there.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And one more thing you didn't hear this part.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I don't want to use someone else's LLM to do the code writing as, you know, I've been pulling down to get this if we get a small slice and remember, we licensed it everywhere and it's being used.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Imagine that.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: And I'm trying to get it.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: If you made a separate product line that was less mature or something to solve this, that could be big opportunity.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Happy to have your, whoever you need to talk to hear all these lists of things we're doing with the number of, you know, the US navy, the air force.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: I mean, it is insane how often how much I'm doing on this, okay?\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: That's incredible.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Yeah, no, sounds great.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: All right, guys.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Oh, yeah.\nSpeaker 920126792653585905: Thank.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: you.\nSpeaker 1375245280237090068: Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: Have a good weekend.\nSpeaker 1297851902566924968: We'll be in touch soon bye.",

3506912551544478537: Good.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Morning, I'm good.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: How are you?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Good evening to you.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: True?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Not quite four 30.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Four 30.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Alright.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Still civilized time to be at work.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah, true.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So, I see that you were in Las Vegas for etls.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I was there absolutely.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: A.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: little bit.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: It was amazing eye opening.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: It was an impressive show.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yeah.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: It's so good and not enough people.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: I have the feeling at these other conferences, there are 4,000 people and it's bullshit content.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: And then you have good content and you have only a 1,000 people, not even… interesting.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Well, I don't know, maybe I don't know if the content would have improved or suffered with more people.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: True.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: It's nice to be able to go to a conference that's not, I'm going to Aws, reinvent in.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I guess it's the first week in December, you know, which is 60,000 people.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So, yeah.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Crazy, right?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: A little bit larger hard to get anything done.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: It's nice when you can see people and then find them again.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: True.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Ivan.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Good afternoon.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: How are you?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Hi, Tom.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Hi, Philip.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: I'm doing great.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: How about you?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Good, good.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: It's good to meet you all.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Ivan.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I may have shook your hand at atls, I'm not sure I was talking to Steve yege in a hall and I feel like you may have come by and said hello to him, but I didn't realize that you're a partner until he explained that to me later on.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: But I'm at sourcegraph.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I am based in San Francisco and at sourcegraph.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I'm responsible for our partner ecosystem.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so that's inclusive of our in club relationships and our software vendor relationships, but I think most importantly, our… systems integrator and consulting and resale kind of relationships.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So that's how I got connected up with you all via Brandon.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I know that you've spoken to a number of other folks over here, but wanted to introduce myself and talk about how we can get you all, what you're interested in and how we can get you all what you need and hopefully do some business together.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Good idea.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Nice.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Sounds great.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Ivan, so you're invited, I think so, what was your thought process?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Right.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: So we currently working with couple of big customers and all of them need AI for different purposes.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: One of the use cases I see for the banking client I'm working with right now is to generate test scenarios and test automation for their software using coding agent.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: And that's where I would like to have a bit of brainstorming and how we can enter from these… sort of angle, right?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: I also like why I would have the first scenarios test because this is banking sector.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: They have the classification of information.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: They have four levels of it like public internal classified and strongly classified, right?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: When we're talking about code, nobody cares, right?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: There is no person identifiable information.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: There is nothing there like you just run the tests, cover your application, you're fine.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: So they have couple of systems in place already.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: They using gemini which they do not provide directly but they provide it through their own application.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: They deploy it to user interface.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: You cannot use it as API.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: You can only like copy paste things there, right?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: And they provide personal licenses to internal employees for gemini cli that's also in place already.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: So they have at least one agent.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: So to get in there, we'll have to convince them that a amp is better than gemini cli, right?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Because it's already in place and we'll have to have a very strong use case there.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Like I would say, we go with testing if you have better ideas, let's discuss it like that's.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Where I'm coming from.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So basically, for your background, Tom, we have the largest German bank, we have the largest German company who manufactures white label fridges and ovens and stuff like that like Ge in the us and we are having AI workshops with all of them.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Basically what we did at the elts with gene Kim on the first day, the wipe coding workshop, we are doing for all our clients constantly.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Basically.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: And obviously… amp is a great idea to implement.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: And I think we talked with the people on the conference quickly about running it even for deutsche bank.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: If they would jump at some point that I think that's half a year in the future to start convincing them.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: But if they would jump on one point to even think about how this is a custom development for them because it's a 90,000 people shop, right?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yes.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And I mean, we rarely see people want to adopt something broadly to begin with.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: You know, we oftentimes see that a pocket of people will get going.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so that first customer that first customer is deutsche bank or someone else.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Correct?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Okay.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I, well, and let me just backing up.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Can you tell me?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I apologize that I've not done more research on xalt.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I'd love to.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Let me, yeah, let me give a wrap up who we are.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So I don't know.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Do you know how were they called Ivan, which was on the conference, the leads, how were they called the other partner?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: I don't know what you're talking about.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Liatro?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah, liatro, have you seen liatro?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Did you talk to them?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I did not know them before, but I did talk to them.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Okay.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yeah.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Okay.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So we are basically, we figured out with liatro, that we are the German copy of liatro.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Basically.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Oh, so that's what we figured out there.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So we are helping our clients in devops CI CD pipelines, AI implementation, everything around coding sdlc process, have a strong partnership with atlassian and are mainly located in Germany with 50 people in Germany and five people in the us right now.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So we are expanding into the us and liatro is expanding into Germany very slowly and small.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So we basically thought we should talk on tomorrow.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: We should talk to joint forces or something like that.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So basically, we are driving this innovations and we are inside our customers and Ivan, you have not heard it yet, but I think I got us the AI workshop with it leadership up to the Cao from sehi yesterday in bsh.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So we will have an AI workshop there.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So basically, we are the external innovation department which have time to look at new things while they are struggling to keep the lights on.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: That's how you could see us basically.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And are you sometimes doing AI only and sometimes doing CI CD kind of devops stuff only?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Everything they want.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Basically, we only use AI now for everything and always sneak it in there.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So it's always AI included and it's always some devops included, but it's always now under the AI world, when we do new projects, it's always an AI project and has also devops parts, but right?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: It's never that we are coming from a devops angle anymore, I think.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Got it.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And did you start it as atlassian consultancy?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Or did you start?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: We started on Phoenix project.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: When the Phoenix project book was written, we started the company on devops basically, but on the side, we did always atlassian consultant because it was always a Jira in the mix, basically, right?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Sure.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Sure.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yeah, very interesting.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: That's super helpful.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Let me if you will.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Just while I'm sitting here, I should do this.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I'm just going to look up deutsche bank.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I believe, I know who the account executive is.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Nope.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: We have lots of.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: How big are you guys at the moment?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So we are about 200 people as a company, as you say, maybe you get some of this from Steve yeagy or the show.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: You probably didn't actually, we started as a company… about 12 years ago and we started as a code search company.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so we need to search all the software source code across your enterprise.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And that was inspired by functionality which is available internally to developers at Google.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: It's not a productized offering.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: But our two partners were palantir, and they were working on large financial services companies, code bases and they said, hey, if we had, if we had that thing they've got at Google, this would be much easier.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: One of them had interned at Google.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so they said, why don't we build that for everyone else.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so I think the code search product indexes… all of the code, which is a very different problem than indexing other types of assets.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And we… built a code search business and ultimately is driving developer productivity developer onboarding, familiarizing yourself with new code bases, of course, reuse of code, making batch changes to code, what we call code monitoring, so you can monitor and track what is in a code base.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: You can search, you can track over time.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so when two and a half years ago is the model shops become clear, what the model shops were doing, we started working on AI coding assistance, and our first sort of generation AI coding system is called Kodi, and it leveraged that index to provide more context to the llms.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Amp is effectively our second generation AI coding system.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so we've got a lot of existing relationships with large enterprises, that are code search customers.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And then of course, a lot of overlap with that with our amp code base.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And then of course, a lot of new amp kind of customers.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Oftentimes, well, you see very rapid adoption of amp in individual developers.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: We see very rapid adoption of amp in small enterprises.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: You'd see a faster adoption of amp in large enterprises than you would see perhaps with a, than you would see perhaps with a traditional kind of software product.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: But you also do see, you know, they want to be careful and go through infosec and those types of things.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Now, I'm not as you talk about that, I'm not certainly scared of an account like deutsche bank.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: We've got, I want to say we've got four of the five top financial institutions as code search customers.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: We've got at least one as an amp customer.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so, we, you know, have been through those types of security teams and audits before we have, you know, we've been through that kind of, you know, been through that kind of stuff however, you know, it's hearing you talk about gemini, not a massive surprise.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And actually, it was funny to, we all commented atls how everyone said, oh, we already own copilot and it was kind of like, you know, Microsoft has sprayed copilot as part of an Ela and people kind of said, yeah, we know there's some other stuff out there but it's so hard to get anything adopted that, you know, we're kind of good with copilot.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And that was all very interesting to us because we were saying, oh, copilot is such an old, you know, kind of technology.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And then we certainly see and it's crazy to say because it's a brand new technology and most technologicals from timeframes, but right now, it's pretty dated.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And then we do see that organizations, I mean, they've adopted duo, they've adopted, you know, Aws Q, gitlab duo, they've adopted Aws Q, they've adopted, you know, gemini, which I think most anyone would, you know, it'd be hard for anyone to argue that those products are very competitive versus the state of the art which is available right now.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Nevertheless, you know, they enjoy, you know, distribution and strong relationships.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I'm not surprised to hear that gemini is in there, but that's a, you know, a product which we differentiate, you know, quite well against, I think it's relatively easy to show how we differentiate against… absolutely.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yeah… in terms of just in terms of how we generally work from a partnership kind of standpoint, we… work in referral.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I mean, the partnership standpoint, you know, we try and be flexible to work with the partner.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: We're small enough as a company that we have got some flexibility in that.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And I've got a reasonable amount of latitude for the partnership team.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: We work with many partners just in a sell with kind of engagement and, you know, what we well, and then we work with some partners in a referral kind of engagement where we're paying a referral fee.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I'll tell you transparently with amp, we're working out, you know, a resale motion, amp, and these other consumption driven kind of products are a little bit different because they don't have the traditional software margins that sane and atlassian does.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so the referral margins are different and frankly not as big as you would find in a traditional software product.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And we're still kind of tinkering with that and finding that now, sort of complementing that from a partnership.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Perspective.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: We're certainly able to provide… trial accounts and free credits and I'll talk about deal support in a second, but I have a gentleman working for me a partner solutions engineer who provides training and use case support and can support you in your usage of amp and in your positioning of amp.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And we've got some more advanced resources for more advanced kind of use cases, you know, sort of, as business requires and sort of dictates, and these are forward deployed kind of engineers that can help with very specific kind of use cases.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: These are, you know, we generally pull them in when it's a very large kind of opportunity.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: I mean, we just call Steve basically, right?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Ivan.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yeah, that's great.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And you'll get not only will you get the answer but you'll get a very entertaining answer.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So so that… that's you know, that's sort of the partnership organization.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And then from the, you know, from the account standpoint, what we do is to pull in a direct, you know, a direct sales team and in this case, they would work through the partner.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: The idea there is that I would never want to have you competing with a, you know, with an account team at sourcegraph.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so, but there are many things that the account team knows and we'll be able to help you position.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Maybe maybe two sentence to our partnership with atlassian.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: I don't know, if, you know, but it was recently changed to five percent discount, on selling licenses.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Basically.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So there is no, there is no 30 percent partnership uplift anymore there.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So it's all co selling since a year already for us.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So, we are one of the next gen partners of the new generation partners which are doing this from the beginning.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: We are co selling with atlassian in teams together at all accounts.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So we have the big ones, right?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: You won't, sell a bosch or a deutsche bank without atlassian.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: And we are doing this co selling motion.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So we are pretty much not looking after a standard after a standard cut of the license costs.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: We are really looking about adoption thing, co selling, 10 year relationship with the clients.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: We, we know bosch for 10 years.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: We know deutsche bank for four years.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Now, we really want to stay long term in there and help from the inside.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So you get the visibility in the inside and the time from the right people, and, we can get them further.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: And, we are living from the value we are generating there and not from license uplift.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Basically just that, you know, how we see ourselves basically.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: That's great.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: That's actually very interesting.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I didn't realize that, with atlassian, we've in, I've spent a lot of time at atlassian previously, but have not spent a lot of time on them.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: With them.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: In the last, you know, nine or nine or 12 months.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: We, well, they had a product called fisheye which was a code search product which we are kind of an adoption for.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And then we spent some time with them, on rovo and other things.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: But they're turns out, their business is relatively different from ours.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So I've spent less and less time with them but, I didn't know about the five percent thing that's interesting.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I'll have to go go go read up on that.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Pretty, pretty interesting motion.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And of course, you know, code search, you know, we index bitbucket which actually is where the fisheye stuff works of.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: course.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So, I'm just looking at deutsche bank here.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I see that we had talked to them back, in 20 23.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So a couple of years ago now and that of course, would have been before we would have positioned amp in there.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: But so we have had some engagement.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: The rep, there is a Guy named, I believe is a Guy named James gaiety who sits in London.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And I'm happy to set up a conversation with James.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I think he would have the best actually and he has a very good solutions engineer who sits in London.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: They would have the best and I'm looking here, it says, they see 7,000 developers within deutsche bank that… they would have.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I think, the best strategy in terms, of, you know, how to, you know, how to approach the account?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yeah, I'd love to sit on that call but I also want to be cognizant so.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Do you see my screen?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So, we also have a page with all the stakeholders there.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: We can, we can share all the stakeholders with you also like what we have as contacts even, I see, the list is not up to date, right?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Our, our last meetings, with the migration and devx teams are missing here.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Maybe it's an edit mode.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Let me see.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: No, they are not in here yet.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So we need to update this quickly.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah, I think that's a good, that you say it's, this James Guy is interesting.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: I think we had him also in a call lately in the architecture board.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: We are currently also talking with them about the future of software development and about GitHub integration, into all the internal security processes like eim and stuff.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So we might be in the same people already that's good.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: James is our Guy from.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: From your side.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Okay.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yes.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So, so, yeah, let's but let's share, these people then let's see who we talk to on deutsche bank side and stuff.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Ivan.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: We need to update this list here, right?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: And look at it together.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Tom, could you spell the last name of James?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: But that's the amp Guy, right?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yes, his last name, is guyetti which is spelled GH a EIDI.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Okay.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I'll talk to James today and make him make an introduction either today or tomorrow all.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Right.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: All.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Right now, I do think, I mean test, is a good use case is a good foot in the door.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: You know, we see a lot of people that actually, you see a lot of people that use amp initially for documentation, explain this code to me, build test cases for this code, etc, because to your point, they may not want to make direct changes to that, but there are lots of ancillary things as part of the stlc that need to be taken care of which amp can be quite, you know, quite effective at.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So, I think that's, a worthy entry point.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I suspect that James and his team will have, you know, some other ideas as well.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Now, are you all set up on amp?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Do you all have amp accounts yourselves?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yep.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Wonderful.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Okay, good.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Are there other accounts that we should see if we can get aligned on?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Definitely, in the future, but it's, we are so much happening at the same time at the moment.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So, we will reach out after we had the first workshop, I think, but we definitely will use it for the workshop and.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: When, when is your first workshop?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So the, no, not planned yet, but, I got the commitment yesterday.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So, so let's see.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: I will keep you updated.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: We will basically, we can share the, what customers do we do workshops with amp?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: And then we can go into motion together.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Very good.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I imagine that you will need, we'll need to make sure that you got appropriate credits, for the workshops and then have you done an NDA with anyone?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: From you guys?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: No, no, okay.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Okay.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: All right.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Well, let me, I'll send you an NDA as well.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I'll do that separately from my instruction to James.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Makes sense.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And then what other AI tools are you all working with?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Cloud code?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Obviously, everything, which, what is out there?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Basically, okay.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: All.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: of them, all of them, we have licensed all of them, I'm.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: at least using four.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Actively.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: So codecs, gemini cli, cloud code and robo, right?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: And, and are you?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Comfortable with amp in terms of its features and functions and differentiation?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: It would be useful to have a kind of deeper session on that.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: I'm comfortable having the stand up, in discord and joining there from time to time.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: So we discord is great.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: We are getting a lot of input there.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: But Ivan, go ahead.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: I'm not the full time coder.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Following this car?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Like like I, so from the sales point of view, I currently do not see much difference between those tools, right?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: So if you would like to go into differentiation and actually saying where amp shines.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: I remember, I think Steve posted on LinkedIn recently, there was comparison of the pull request acceptance between the tools and amp was on top.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: It was like a post from this week or last week, like, you know, to really get the point, why would they, like?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: I already have gemini cli, right?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: So why would I pay for them?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Like on a deutsche bank level, right?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: But when I have like 7,000 developers each developer spend, I know, 100 bucks per month that's a lot of money.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: So the question is, why would I do that?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: And this is something which would be really interesting to understand.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Definitely.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Play through some questions, basically, right?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: We have our view on the thing, we have our argumentation, right?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Why it's better.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: But sharing that, and talking about that is always helpful.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: I guess, yeah, right.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Okay.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I mean, for gemini, we actually see quite a bit of results kind of differentiation.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: You know, we believe that is I'm sure, Steve.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Well, actually, you may or may not know, we rely on the cloud models relatively heavily, but we do use chat gpt for the oracle and we use, I believe, for summarizing effectively based upon the task, we are going to a purpose built, you know, we're going to a model where we believe that, the performance and results, are the best.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And actually for all of those things, it's pretty obvious now.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so that, you know, is all resulting in, you know, a higher level, of results that we're that we are generating now.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Of course mileage varies on that, in some places that resonates incredibly well and people say, you know, there's no comparison in other places.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: They say, you know, it's it seems to be, it seems to be closer there then is, you know, just, a user experience.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so how people like how, the features, are integrated and that's largely up to, you know, the taste of the developers and how well we work within the standardized kind of development environments, that they have.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And then more strategically, I will say, with some buyers and this is not with all buyers but some buyers are uncomfortable working with a tool from a model shop given that the rate of change within the model shops.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so, I mean, I'm just you're talking about cloud code.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: You know, I think that it's hard to argue that flood codes is not the most effective solution from the model shops right now.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: But who knows, given this market, do they get leapfrogged?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And so sourcegraph is in a unique position that we do have the ability to change the models that we work with relatively easily.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And we're always testing as new versions of models come out or new areas of functionality and are able to incorporate them quickly.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Where if you are, you know, let's say if you're all in, on gemini and who knows, I mean, everybody's always saying that, you know, Google's next thing is, can be amazing.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Maybe it is, I'm the people that are stuck on, you know, maybe some people are standing on cloud code, who knows, but many people like, the positioning of sourcegraph housing the market not is a model house perhaps?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Pardon.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Sorry, pitch.\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Deck pitch deck, do you have one like to have all the points like as a powerpoint slide or something?\nSpeaker 9058670954222327733: Is there something which summarizes this differentiation already?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Oh, I actually can't think, of a slide right now but I'm sure that we have, I'm sure that within the field there are many.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So, let me see what I can find.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Okay.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So, okay.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So I will talk to James today or tomorrow.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I will make an introduction there.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: I will get you an MN… NDA so, we can speak, you know, openly appreciate your openness, you know, so so far here.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And then I'll get you a few more ideas, on use cases and competitive differentiation.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Either James or I will.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Awesome.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Please please.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Keep us posted on, you know, if you're preparing for workshops and make sure that we well do whatever is appropriate, you know, one, making sure that you've got credits and then that you get the materials that you need.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And then we're we are of course happy to support those workshops however, is appropriate given how they're set up sounds?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Like a plan.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Awesome.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Cool.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: All.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Right, gentlemen.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Thanks a lot for the initial talk that's amazing.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: It's it's good to see all the movement in the, in this area really exciting times and talk to you soon.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: It's.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: it's super exciting times, crazy how fast it's all moving.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So, I like, your approach.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: You guys should be a I'm looking forward to building a partnership with you all because, you know, it, the intersection of sdlc… and AI is a very interesting place for us to be.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: And frankly, I mean, I told you the outro guys, this is, I think a very strategic place to be because yes, going and adopting this in a meaningful way across your sdlc is a very different.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: It's a very different question than how do you go vibe code?\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So I think there's a lot of business but of course, a huge amount of return there.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: So, correct?\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Yeah, that's where we see our future in consulting and we will still do some sdlc stuff and some CI CD stuff, in implementing this, but it's completely different in the future.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: I.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Think.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Yeah, yeah, agreed.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Agreed.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: All right.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Very good.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Awesome.\nSpeaker 3506912551544478537: Thanks for the time.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Talk to you soon.\nSpeaker 199659431390087161: Bye bye.",

2996433536695174620: How's it going?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Good?\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: How are you?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Good as well.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Amazing.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Nice to see you again.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: How's your month of September been?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Not too bad.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: How are you?\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Good.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I'm good.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Thanks for setting aside some time today just to give some context.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I know previously on the account, I've been on the account since February and there's been limited strategy conversations or live engagement touches.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I figured it might make sense to me today if that's something you think would be helpful to continue on a monthly basis or even quarterly.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I'm happy to support that.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: But yeah, I would love to hear from you if you find live updates or partnering closer is helpful based on your sourcegraph subscription or how you streamline things today.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So I mean, firstly… thank you for setting this up.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: It's always good to have conversations around what we could do differently in the partnership and obviously leverage the licenses that we are paying for.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: There's.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Been sort of an interesting trend for us internally at atlassian.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So, in a sense, what I see is at the moment, we are both from a strategic perspective as well as from really on the ground usage perspective, seeing a lot more traction in our internal products and our internal tools.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: And this is reflective of why as an example, we are seeing the usage taper off or at least flatten for sourcegraph.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: And I see that trend continuing at least in the near term.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Now, things can always change and there can always be nuances to what I'm saying.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: But in general, that's where we are at.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: And so I think fundamentally a world where I would see rapid uptick in our usage… of sourcegraph in the short term.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: At least I don't see it.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So just wanted to call that out.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So we are clear on where things are from our perspective.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So let me pause there and get your feedback on this, yeah.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: No, that's really helpful.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I think just in this industry, obviously, things move so quick and I think it's exciting that you guys are building things in house that your developers prefer.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I think if anything, we rather our customers have a strong internal workflow and we want everyone to be successful.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: So I totally hear you and happy to kind of just continue to keep an eye on things.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I think what I could do going forward is always happy to send any product updates your way.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: And if any sound interesting, we could always hop on the line or talk about it if there's any like red flags or really exciting moments.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I think something really relevant that we just rolled out that.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I think one of the main reasons I wanted to chat today was really relative based on if you continue seeing developers use tools internally is that we just actually rolled out a sourcegraph MCP server.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: So this will allow you to connect AI agents and applications to your sourcegraph code search.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: And this is in version six point eight.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: So you would just have to, you know, align with that version.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: But this feature is currently available as experimental.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: So it has no additional cost today.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: But again like seeing how customers work with it to determine PMP.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: But I've seen a lot of customers really excited about this when they're building things in house because they can still leverage the impact of your index code search.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Yeah, that's a great point.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: I will run that by the team.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So you said we need to be on version six point eight and above.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: And I'm saying that, but you guys are on six point eight, so you're good to go and I can send documentation.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Do you prefer email or is it easier to slack?\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Like, is it easier to message you in a different way?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Slack is generally what we use, but email is fine as well.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Are you on atlassian slack or like do we need to add you as a?\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I should be.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: So I've worked with, oh, I think I see you.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I'm trying to just, I've worked with other contacts via slack at atlassian.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: But I'm not sure if I'm a part of like your guys' ecosystem in slack?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Oh, no.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: But I can see if I could bring you up here.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: You might not come up on mine.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Are you part of the support channel by chance for atlassian?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: No.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Okay.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: That's fine.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: We could stick with email.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: I think that's totally okay.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Okay.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Perfect.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Yeah, like send me the latest documentation and whatnot.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: And I will, I'm sure there will be some interest.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: A lot of people have been asking for apis and whatnot, which again have pros and cons.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So I think an MCP here would certainly help.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Okay, perfect.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: When you see kind of users moving towards other tools internally at atlassian, are they other code search tools or like what other tools have been kind of like moving dev usage towards?\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So this is primarily more, this is not necessarily something that we have as part of our product portfolio, but in essence, we've built our own code… search for our engineers at atlassian.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So this is in essence our internal tooling.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Okay.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Cool.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Okay.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: That's exciting.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Okay.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Amazing.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Well, yeah, love.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Any feedback on the MCP or if any questions come up.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I think something else that we spoke about on site was deep search and that is, you know, a complimentary product as well to search and it's definitely like unique to sourcegraph or at least I haven't seen many other people have like similar solutions to it.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: So, I mean,\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: that was one that Tarun was excited about.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Like when we met, we also talked to you about what we're doing with robodev and whatnot, right?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So, in general, that… area is something that we'd certainly want to explore.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Do you have like becoming part of your product offering right now?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Or where is deep search at currently?\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: It's currently within the search UI.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: So it's a part of sourcegraph.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Traditionally, I know we spoke about another AI agentic tool called amp.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Oh.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Amp is the one that's the additionalizing.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: But deep search is already part of it.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Okay.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Yeah, deep search is already available.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Let me just actually just for… might as well just show you quickly.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I won't do like a demo.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I know we already did but just to get kind of an idea of sure.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: So this is, you know, the sourcegraph UI and then it would be just like code search on the toggle bar on the top left.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: We have a deep search toggle.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: What I wanted to bring up today was this was research preview when we met beginning of September.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Now this is officially moved to GA.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: And with that starting October, we're actually putting free allocation deep search queries on each of our customers' accounts.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: And it's based on the way your license is set up.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: And then from there, you could like purchase more deep search queries.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: The positive part is we're not seeing many customers like hit their deep search allotment.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: But since atlassian is discounted in such a degree, you guys have such a great rate.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Currently, you actually aren't set up for any deep search queries that are free.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: But I raised my hand because I know this is like something we spoke about.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: So would love for you to kind of think about it over the next week or so.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: As this becomes officially like rolling out on October fifteenth, we are open to giving atlassian some free deep search queries to test it out if you would like with a specific like power user cohort, and I can give you some enablement like in a developer guide that I put together a PDF, one pager.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I can send that via email, but I figured I want to still give you guys the opportunity to try it, see if there's impact and if so, we could talk about options?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So that's a great idea… because you said it's in preview.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Is it already enabled for our users currently at atlassian?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Do, you know?\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Let me check.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: You do have to turn it on.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: That is something that you need to do.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: And then also you would need to sign an AI addendum because you are technically using llms within that solution… that's kind of the steps of if people that have like our AI products are able to just turn it on because they already have signed like language around the llms.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: But that's kind of where atlassian would sit.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: So I'm happy to send the addendum just so you have it even if you're not interested, but it's just the first step of it.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Please do, please, do I'll socialize that internally?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: I'd love for us to at least as you said, test it out, see where the value is.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: And if there is, then we can figure out what else we do on the licensing aspects.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: But, yeah, that's a good call out.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Okay.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Amazing.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Yeah, if you want to just look at everything and then kind of give me the green light when, and if you're ready to move forward to test that complimentary, obviously.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: And then also if you have kind of some estimate of certain number of maybe power users that you want to enable this for, that will allow us to also think.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Okay, like what makes sense with that free allotment?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Makes sense.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Yeah, sounds good.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Cool.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Okay, perfect.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Alrighty.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Those were the two main items that I had today.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I think also you guys when we met mentioned migrations.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: And again, another part of your contract today is you have the tool batch changes, which just helps with large migrations.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: That is like a fancy find and replace tool.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: We're seeing about like 10 to 25 monthly users using that atlassian.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: But if there are major migrations happening, I just, I think it's worth highlighting.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: I can also send you information.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Are you looped in on that product at all batch changes?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Yes, partially.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: But if you could send me some data, there are a couple of teams that work quite extensively on migration.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So I'm happy to send it to them and actually ask them to see if the solution works for them.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Okay, perfect.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: And this is one of those legacy products that again is like a part of code search.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: There's no specialization with that with research preview or anything.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: And we did a lot of product enhancements to it in the last six months.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: So excited to see if I'm happy to meet with that team as well.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: If they do have questions or want like a formalized training around it sounds.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Good.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Okay.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Amazing.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Okay.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Those were my three main items.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: So anything else top of mind for you?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Yeah, no, I think this is good.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: The one big one which I think we should certainly discuss is deep search and see how that goes.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: But I'm also excited about the MCP aspect.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So let's figure that out.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Yeah, the migrations one we can take it offline outside of that.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: I think for the moment, we have not sort of… when are we up for renewal?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: This is likely in March, right?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: If I recall.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Yeah, I think you're 100 percent correct?\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Yeah, March thirtieth.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Okay.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: So let's maybe either towards the end of this year or early Jan start having conversations on what that looks like and what would the next steps be there?\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Okay, perfect.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Yeah, that sounds great.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Let me just actually know in my calendar here we could, I'll just make sure to reach out maybe mid November even to start conversations early.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: That's about a little under 150 days out.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: If that works for you.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Let's do it.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Okay?\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Perfect.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Okay.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Wonderful.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Perfect.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Well, really appreciate the time and yeah, we'll send those resources today by end of day.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: So you have those in hand?\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Awesome.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Okay.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4952620364464606419: Happy Friday.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2996433536695174620: Bye.",

Perfect.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Hey, Mohamed.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: How are you?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Good, good.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: What do you want?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Sorry?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: I had a moment there where it was just difficult connecting to the zoom but glad we're connected here.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: How's everything?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: It's good.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: It's a Friday, yeah.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Happy Friday.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Your pleasure being my first call today.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So excited for that.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Just getting ready.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: I think family's going out to dinner tonight all, you know, fun things.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So just stuff like that.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: What about you?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Yeah, same at the end of my day today, it's seven P.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: M.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So I'm taking this.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: This is my last meeting for today and I should just start enjoying my weekend.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Oh, absolutely.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Well, thank you for staying on late if it is any solace to you.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Like we can always end a few minutes early if that would help.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: But I definitely am grateful that you're taking the time later on a Friday to reconnect, I guess to jump right into it.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Then my colleague Carter had pulled me aside and he mentioned that the two of you had connected last year about some just code AI initiatives that you folks have at cme.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: It sounded like there was interest in the time potentially about evaluating Cody and that there were some competing initiatives across the organization for you.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And some folks at cme in particular, definitely wanted to give you a look at what we've updated since then with amp.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: I don't know if you're privy to amp or if you've heard of it or if Carter shared any of that context with you, but I'm happy to, regardless.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: I did want to take a step back and just, you know, fill in the gaps, hear what's happened for you individually.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And then for the cme organization since then it's definitely something it's an exciting time to be working in software to be using AI tools to be thinking about how to apply those tools to your organization.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And, you know, I'm not a developer by trade, but I've now been in the software industry for four or five years and it's been fun up leveling and learning about it myself and then coming alongside engineering leaders such as yourself and thinking about how to up level your engineering team.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So anyway, that's enough for me but I'd love to hear a little bit more on what you're working on and kind of the gap since we last connected.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So first, nice to meet you.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So by the time we did the meeting a year ago, we were doing an evaluation for one of the projects that you're working on.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So why we chose sourcegraph at that time is that we wanted a tool that would access several microservices at a time.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: And we did some research and we found that sourcegraph might be a potential for us.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: And by that time, we had to switch priorities from the business.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So they said that we can leave this project for a moment.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: And I replied back to Carter at that time that we want to switch priorities.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So the management is not interested in this project anymore.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: I mean, the project that we were working on.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So we switched priorities, but I would like to hear from you currently, what we are working on to see the added value from your side.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So I can discuss it further with the upper management.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So the issue that we were facing one year ago.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Now, I think it's resolved.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So for example, we're using codex, we're using GitHub, copilot, we're using cursor.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So for example, for codex, I can simply create a new repo and I can grab all the different microservices, the folders inside this repo, and codex can have access to the whole repo and it can do analysis.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: It can answer all the questions for me, the same for the GitHub copilot.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So I would like to hear from you.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: What are the added values in this case for the amp tool?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Wonderful.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So what I can do is briefly share my screen and show a little bit of that information for you Mohamed.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: I guess what would be super interesting to hear in terms of?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And I don't have differentiators with codex pulled up here.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: But what you're seeing are just some basic differentiators between cursor and cloud code and amp, as they apply to agentic use cases or which audiences are optimized for each of these tools and how they're accessed and how you can collaborate.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: I'd be curious to know just from your end between those tools and the initiatives that you're either working on now or that you are reentertaining now following last year, like which of these tools do you enjoy the most?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Where do you see any gaps?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And what do you see is needing to be improved?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Yeah, it's a good question.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So I tried both cursor and cloud code.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So if you want cursor versus codex, I would go with codex because I think it has first, it's a better user experience because I would like to see everything inside the browser.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: I can ask codex to do several tasks in parallel and it can then reply back to me after a certain amount of time sending me the pull request.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: I can simply review them.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: It will create the branch for me and all this stuff.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Either I merge or I ask codex to do another changes.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So between cursor and codex, I would choose codex for cloud code.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: I think the added value of it is that it's a full agent.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So you can simply run the agents from the command line on windows.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So I think it's an added value regarding that.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So I think if I want to work, it would be a mix between codex and cloud code because in this case, I can simply run the agents on my machine on my desktop.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Let's say I'm using windows, I can do whatever I want, can integrate it with MCP agents.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: And for the changes from the code perspective, I would go with codex and ask codex to do whatever it want… for GitHub.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Copilot.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: The added value of GitHub copilot is that I have the ability to switch the models.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So I can either go to cloud, I can use cloud or I can use codex or I can use… gemini.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So this is an added value for GitHub copilot.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So basically we're working with all of this stuff, but I was interested to see in this case what would be the added value of using amp?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Yep.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: One quick call out as you can see, and as you're diving into these different tools, I think every provider is taking a different approach as to how do we tackle AI coding assistance?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: What is going to optimize for quality and value for our end users?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: You're talking about how codex you can operate more agentically in parallel in the background maybe than cursor and cloud code being available in cli or using MCP agents with codex.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So I think that number one, I think it would be good for me to kind of start at the top in terms of what is our strategy with amp, how is amp, different than strategies we've taken in the past?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Where are we now?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And what might make sense for you folks to do in the future?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: I guess as a call out after this, we'd be happy to schedule a more customized demo for some of your end developers to see and set you guys up on a trial.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Should that make sense?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: But I want to make sure that I give you some ground to stand on here and we can kind of learn together.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: I think a good place to start to set the context is since November of 20 22.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: With the kind of chat gpt moment.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: We've been applying AI to the software development cycle.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: I don't need to say this to, you know, this and I think it started with some really fun autocomplete functionalities, rag based chat bots.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So moving from your basic, you know, starting day copilot, going into tools like Kodi, where you could access more contextually aware AI coding assistance.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Then came the VS code forks whether it be cursor and windsurf.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And those have continued to progress in terms of how they're agentically applied to the code base.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And now what I'm hearing more so, and I think you could apply codex into this latter category of full agentic tools being amp, cloud code, codex, being able to autonomously look throughout your code base and really push something up here all the way to remediation, right?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: This leads into what makes amp, different, feel free to read some of these points at your leisure.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: But what I would call out as it pertains to what you're you were calling out, amp, is going to be available anywhere your developers are working anywhere you're working.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So whether that be VS code, jetbrain, cli, amp, is going to have an interactive mode for all of those.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: We're going to meet you where you're working out of one key differentiator is that you mentioned with copilot, being able to switch different models is really helpful because with codex, obviously you're going to be locked into open AI models and with cloud code, you're going to be locked into anthropic models.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And what we've seen being more so having a research lab mentality is that for some of like gpt five, we found very helpful for deep reasoning use cases and understanding the code base and being thoughtful and working through unit tests.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Whereas the sonnet models tend to be very proactive and quick and thorough in generating code more quickly.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And so, we've taken a step back and have taken a similar stance to copilot in that, okay, the happy medium here seems to be allowing for model agnosticism and for using different models for different use cases, which I think is the right approach where we take a differentiated approach from copilot is that we think switching between models is too much cognitive overhead for you and your cme developers to be undertaking.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: What do I mean?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Similar to how gpt five may be better at deep reasoning.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: But sonnet four point five is better for generating code.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Some of your developers may not know that or may not have the time to study that or to up level on that.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And you don't want people switching between different models and getting different outputs and not adhering to best practices for your particular development practices.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So what we do is we do the research on the front end and align those different models to the different workflows that your developers are enacting.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So when you're working within amp, there is not going to be a model drop down.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: What you can be guaranteed is you're going to be working with frontier models for a given use case.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And we're not cutting corners with that.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: We're providing whatever model we believe to be the premier model into that workflow for you and your developers that's one.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And I want your response to this in a moment.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: But that dovetails with the second aspect in that unlike traditional sas based tools, we are not pricing amp on a per user per month flat subscription based fee.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: This is going to be purely usage based.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So we're optimizing for outcomes here.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: We're not requiring you and your team to do a big upfront commitment for an entire year across your entire development force.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: This can be something where you start with, you know, 5,000 dollars of credits or more and your team can burn those credits down over time, ensuring that you're going to have access to the best models for a given use case and that, you know, there aren't going to be constraints.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Towards the end of the month or whatever, we're going to a cheaper model.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So that's where when you think of amp as it stands between your codexes and cursors and copilots of the world, amp is going to be your premium AI coding assistant, that is usage based paired with the best models and it's optimized for quality.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: We definitely are taking a differentiated approach and would want to hear kind of your immediate take on that.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: I want to explanation regarding how it will choose the model behind the scenes.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So based on the use case based on the question, it will change the model behind the scenes or how is it going in this case?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Yes.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: In terms of like how we do that, that's something that we're pre configuring based on.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Like for instance, if I go up here and select all the different like use cases that amp is conducting on behalf of our customer base, we have already pre configured amp to where, you know, if you're generating a unit test, or if you're trying to understand the code base, you're generating an agent dot MD file or you're updating legacy code, we have done the research on our hand to know which model is going to be best for that workflow.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And then as a default model, if there are use cases that we haven't thought of, it is going to default to cloudsonic at four point five.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So that is how we've configured amp?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: OK, gotcha.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Cool.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: That being said, I did want to ask, I know we had this from our last interaction, but know that you folks are working within GitHub and gitlab, primary repo.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: It sounds like is gitlab number one.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Is that still true?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And number two, are you folks, you mentioned you like working within cli?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Would you say that's common throughout cme or other folks like using their editors or how does that look for your team?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: No, it's you can think, you can say that each one has his own perspective.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So some guys would like the cli, some guys would like using this code.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Some guys would like to use directly the agent on the browser.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So it's up to each one.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So from my perspective, I'd like to use always to use codecs because it has a better user experience and better flexibility.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Sometimes I need to do and I usually do it for let's say I'm doing a research for about certain stuff or I want reasoning.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So I use it, I use gpt five sometimes for quick implementations.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Let's say I'm updating a file.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: I can go and use GitHub copilot.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: And I can simply change the model based on the use case that I have.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Okay.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Wonderful.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: In terms of security requirements.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Is this a situation where your organization has really dove in headfirst trying to apply these tool sets?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Are there any types of like table state requirements in terms of soc two or zero data retention that's important for your team?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Yeah, it's very important for us.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So basically all the tools that we are using are enterprise tools because security is very important for us.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: And I think based on the meeting that we did a year ago, it seems you have, we talked about the enterprise version, right?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Yes, where we can have everything deployed on a machine dedicated for us on azure, right?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So Cody at that time did offer that.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So what I did want to go ahead and get to the front of here with amp is, amp would be a multi tenant solution.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: And where it will be deployed?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: It will be deployed.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: I have my security reference pulled up here, so hopefully you can still see my screen.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So it would be GCP.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Okay.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: On your GCP account?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Yes.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Okay.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: This is a concern for us.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Yeah, this is a red flag actually.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Okay.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Okay.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And if I could ask you why is that just because in terms of AI tooling, you folks would want to have everything in house or what does that look like?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: For, yeah, we prefer that because we have some code that would be, we don't want, we want it always to be private.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: We don't want anyone to have access on the code.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So that's why?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Yep.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: I will call out.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: I don't know if this would remediate that concern.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: It is something that tends to help with our other customers, but we do guarantee zero data retention for any inputs and outputs.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So that helps, we have soc two type two compliance.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Yeah, like I called out, we're not going to be able to deploy this fully on premise.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Okay, cool.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Okay, gracias.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Wonderful.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So I guess follow up question to that, I can send this security reference your way along with our terms if that'd be helpful for your team to review.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: But I guess starting at the end in mind here, is that going to be a non starter for your group or is this still something that we could consider?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: I think, we need some time.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So so on the time being, we don't have any use case that we think that we might require a new tool other than the tools that we are currently use.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So, we have cursor, we have GitHub, copilot, we have codecs.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So for now, I think we're good.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: But in case we found something that will not be solved using these tools, then in the case, I would go and send email back to you to see if we have anything that might be solved from your side.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Yeah, absolutely.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So no, we can stay in touch asynchronously about that.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And so I can set a note on my end to follow up with you just as we have some new updates and we're offering new things forward looking with that in mind because it sounds like maybe right now it's not the best time to re, reconnect on this exactly?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Are there things that you would anticipate like, hey, it would be really helpful if our agents could do this or this is a certain pain that our developers are working through right now or are you guys in a standpoint where it, you know, between cursor and codecs, really, things seem to be working well.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: I think for the time being between cursor codecs and GitHub copilot or everything is working well, so I would like to hear back from you in case you had some, something that would be an… added value or an issue that would be solved… through your tool.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So, in case you implemented or added a new feature that would be an added value that we cannot achieve through codecs or cursor or GitHub copilot, then in this case, I would like to hear back from you because in this case, it would be interesting for the management, for the upper management.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Because if I want to talk about this for the upper management, they're going to say, what are the added value?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: In this case?\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Since we're using these, we're paying money for all these three tools.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So we have, we are about like 500 employees employee.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So we're paying the enterprise version for both codecs cursor and GitHub copilot.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So if there is an added value that does not exist in these tools and we found that might be used by us and it will speed things up for us.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Then in this case, reply back to me and I can mention it for the upper management to see if they are okay with it.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And that in mind, similar to what we talked about, I'll definitely follow up, just overviewing a few of those differentiators I mentioned being we were not locked into a certain model family.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: We're going to meet your developers where they are removing the cognitive overhead of having to choose models so I can share some of those.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: But what I acknowledge about those differentiators is, you know, it's easy for me to say that.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And then it's one thing for developers actually to experience that and more of a subjective fashion where they're actually using it and seeing it head to head.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And, you know, one thing that some of our early customers do is use amp as an extension like within cursor or use it in their cli and compare it to cloud code.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And so one one offer that we do have that, you know, I don't know if this would be interesting right now or not.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: But we do offer trials in terms of offering one week access for you and your devs to try out.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Amp, you know, as much as you'd like.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So we can set that up in terms of seeing, hey, is this better?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Are we seeing value gains from it?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Is it adding additional value over the tools we already have?\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So that's something, I can send you details on what that would look like in terms of us setting that up… and go from there because I think our differentiators are best felt when your devs are in the product and comparing it head to head for a given use case, whether it be codecs or copilot.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So that would be my recommendation but would want to take this at whatever pace you think would be most appropriate.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: The thing here is that, we cannot use any trial version on our code.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So for security reason, so in this case, I don't think this would work for us.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: The upper management will not accept that because security here can be tolerated from our side.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So what I would go for, we can stay in touch.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So if you have anything or any new features that have been added to amp, and you think that these, you can just send me these or these new features.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: And if I think that if I see that I'm interested in one of these and I found that these does not exist in the existing tools that we have, then I can reply back to you and I need to discuss it first with the management to see if they're okay with it.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Yep, totally fair.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Totally fair.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Cool.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: So, mohammed, from here, I will send you that information particularly in what additional value amp does drive for our customers, particularly as it applies to security.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And, and then I'll also send some documentation on how we're different from some of the tools you're already using.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Yeah, if.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: It would be very helpful.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: And then if it makes sense, to reconnect to set up a trial, happy to do.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: So, yeah, thanks, man.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: And nice to meet you and have a good day.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Yeah, happy Friday.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201: Happy.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: Friday, man.\nSpeaker 7214577127061178220: See you see.\nSpeaker 1776013031251753201:

you.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Can't hear you?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Can you hear me now?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I can hear you now.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Okay?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Great.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Sorry, my laptop microphone is acting up.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Oh, that's all good.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Don't worry.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Well, yeah, I'll just quickly introduce myself.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: My name is isuru I'm based out of Sydney, Australia.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I'm a field engineer working on the amp team.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So at the moment, my team, so the field engineers, we're focused on working with our customers on the most complex use cases, hacking around with new solutions and things like that.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And right now we've picked a bunch of accounts and we look at the top token users within those accounts and we just want to understand your workflow, what you did, what you liked, what you didn't like, I had a look, I think like you used it.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It's been a little while now, so maybe you were trialing it out, which is cool.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So I wanted to hear your perspective on how that trial was.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And then if you're interested, I have some things some newer features I can show you about like new SDK and some automation workflows and things.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: If you're interested, I can show you those things as well.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Okay, great.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So I'm mitja, I'm here the lead backend engineer at outfit.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: And yeah, we've been trialing amp.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So you guys put, I don't know one K, I think on our account for testing before we used, I mean, even now we use Kodi for a year or so and yeah, now we wanted to try more agentic approach and yeah, you guys gave us some credits.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So I've been using amp for, I don't know a few weeks.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I think now we've run out of credits.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So no more amp, unfortunately… but yeah, I've been, I used it for a few use cases.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So what type of use cases do you use it for?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Okay.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So we do backend software development.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So what I did was mixture of java and python.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So I used it for, I had a couple of use cases.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So one use case was, for example, I had to implement a simple feature… that was done already before in a similar way… and everything was well defined.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: There was exact definition of what the feature should look like, what it should do.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: And also most of the codes you could already reference on a previous one of the previous commits.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, yeah, I just gave the Jira, I mean, information from the Jira, and previous commits to amp with some instructions, what I expect also how to run the tests.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: And yeah, this was, this worked very well.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: This example.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: That's good.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah, a lot of people who use it like in the trial, especially like if they're coming from the Kodi style tooling, they don't know to like, oh, I gotta give it a reference to here's like something that worked, these are git commits use tooling, use the unit tests, and then amp can fix itself.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So to hear that you used it that way is awesome.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Did, you, and you said you had a good experience using it that way?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: That was, that was really good.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: It was fast.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Well, fast.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I don't know because I went to do other things in the meantime, but yeah, it liked, I only needed to the first prompt.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Did it, the solution worked?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: The only thing that I needed to fix after was some documentation was a bit off or I wanted it's something written in a more specific way, but yeah, I think that manually.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: But I did my homework and I read the reference manual before.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Also, I watched some YouTube videos.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: What's the best practice of using these agentic tools like cloud code.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: And so, yeah, this worked really well.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: This example.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Nice.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Sorry.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Go on.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, I have a few more or we can talk about this.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Keep keep going.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I'll I'm just taking some notes.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Okay.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So the next example was I was, so the previous one was java and gradle build systems.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: But the next one was python and uv build… system or package system, whatever.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: And that was implementing a completely new feature in like python mono repo.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So create a new like slack bot basically.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So yeah, we needed a slack bot which would receive a webhook parse… the webhook.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: The webhook actually was email sent from Sendgrid, and it had to parse it.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: And then based on what it parsed, it had to send it to a slack channel.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Okay.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So based on the response?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: It was basically billing anomaly alerts.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: We have a cloud provider that we use and we get alerts about if we are spending too much.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: And unfortunately, this cloud provider supports only email alerts.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Okay.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, we forward this email to Sendgrid, and Sendgrid, sends it via webhook, okay, to our API.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: But yeah, basically, it's it was a new service in a mono repo where there is bunch of other services.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So I could give it reference how other services looks like and what I expect the slack message to look like, what to include.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I also gave it the format of the email.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I exported the email and in the eml format and I gave it as an example.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: And yeah, I wrote this and I also wrote that it should write some unit tests so it could get a feedback loop if stuff is working, right?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, yeah, again, yeah, so just.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Just on that use case.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So, if you, I guess like I'm keen to hear your perspective on how faster or smoother that process was or maybe it wasn't compared to, I guess how you would do it traditionally.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So, I guess in your case, it'd be using Kodi.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: With, with Kodi, it's just, I would still write the majority of code myself probably, but then ask Kodi to implement maybe specific parts.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: But, yeah, it's to be honest from Kodi.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I don't have such a good experience of like completely writing new stuff.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I find it more useful of like adding some parts of the code or fixing some parts of the code.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Like more tactful little changes rather than big.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: The big unit, it's hard to do it with Kodi because the context is narrower and yeah, you have to, you have to spend more time if you want to do this, I think, yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: If you want to quantify it, so like if you want to do that same feature without, amp… how much longer do you think it would take?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So for example, this bot slack bot, the majority of time I would spend on parsing that email, you know?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So I think I did this in like I think with amp, I did it in half a day with prompting like it was on and off, you know?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So it took more days but effectively, I think it took half day of my work with amp, if I wouldn't if I would do it like manually, I would need, I know around two days I think to write this thing.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, so yeah, this was also, I needed a bit more with like previous like junior level feature because this was a completely new feature but it still saved me a lot of time and it brought unit tests and the documentation.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I needed more prompts to get it.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I mean, I needed to chat more but yeah, it's it was also, this was a very good experience.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Oh, that's good.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But what were there any things that you didn't like?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Like, what was your, or any things that you felt that we should change in your opinion?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: That's a, good question.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I mean, it's still not there for like more tasks where I didn't have good experience, for example, where something is going wrong or there is some error, you cannot find, you know, for example, we bumped a version of quarkus which is a java framework and the builds didn't work anymore.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: And, you know, since it was very new release of quarkus, AI… just couldn't figure out, you know, what was wrong?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I spent a lot of time.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I think I even spent 100 dollars on this, but yeah, like, yeah, just to debug complex issues.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: It's I felt like I spent more time with battling with amp than I would myself to dive deep.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So you felt you could have, you could have just kind of gotten to that same conclusion faster with less tokens.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Oh, I just gave up on the amp for this particular issue because I saw that I already spent a lot of money and I was getting nowhere.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, yeah, I just figured it out manually.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, for this like something is wrong, I don't know what the hell it is here are some logs and it just tries to guess but it, it's you know, it didn't solve it.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Right.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Funny.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: You say that because other people I've spoken to, they said that use case is where, it has saved them time.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Obviously, it depends on the issue.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Of course.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So like that's a very loose thing.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But where, like even in my own experience where it's like, oh, this has gone wrong.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I don't know where this has introduced like where was this introduced?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I like, I find that amp, is actually really good to recursively look through git like you'll have like maybe like something in the log, it'll have like a clue of where that file was.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And then I did have to instruct it to look through git history and then find root cause.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Did you, did you try something like that by any chance?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Actually, I knew which version of the framework broke our build, but I wanted to find out why did it break our build?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Oh, and that's what you're saying?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: There's no information.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: In the end, you know, I had to, in the end, I had to look into the source code of the framework and of quarkus and rebuild some manual rebuild with extra, debug logging and things like this to be able to figure out, you know, it would, I mean, yeah, I knew which version broke, but I still wanted to upgrade to this version with some work around, you know, I.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: See.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So you need to actually pull the code and understand it.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Because there's not, you know, there's something in what they did.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Some changes, broke it for us and yeah, I opened an issue for them and, oh,\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: okay.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So that level?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Okay.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So it's that level of issue?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Otherwise, if it's just an exception, you get, you know, this crashes, what could be wrong?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, of course, it finds the issue pretty quickly especially if it can run the build or test to reproduce it that's very good.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I just found that, you know, it's having the feedback loop with the tests and build that's like game changer, I think.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah, it is.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It makes me glad to hear that you read the manual.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It sounds like you did your own research and, you have an understanding of how to do that.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It's yeah, it's yeah, you had like a good experience from the start.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: A lot of, a lot of my job is actually talking to people like you and they might be like, oh, but I didn't like tell it to run unit tests and then I'll have to tell them.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So I feel like you're doing all of that stuff already, which is cool.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Also the reference manual, it's not long.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, it's a, you know, it's a, you don't have to spend a lot of time to read it, which is nice.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: You know, there is no like bullshit inside.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah, they keep it very short almost too short sometimes, but I'm glad to hear it was, good for you, on your use case with the, where you had to pull down the source code.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Do you know about like if you're in repo one and let's say you're using a framework in and you've pulled the source code down in repo two.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Do you know about that feature where you can reference other repos by passing in the absolute part?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Do you know about that?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: No, no, I didn't know that actually.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So let's say if we go through the problem you had before, so let's say, you know, you have, I forgot what it was called.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Was it quark?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Quarkus?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So, you have the repo for quarkus pulled in one thing and you have your application code and then you're saying, okay, we've upgraded to this framework.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Something's gone wrong.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I know the problem's in that framework here's, the absolute path for quarkus go through the revision history, try pinpoint the error, and then it could do some automation that way but you're still working in your source code, but it can look through the other one.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: You just need to reference the absolute path and it can jump other locations.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Well, yeah, but that's on the local file system, right?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It's gotta be local everything.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I'm just afraid here, you know, I would probably have to be very specific otherwise it could spend a fortune probably because that framework is really big.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: You know, you'd.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: want to definitely give it some guidance of like, hey, this is the area, things like that, cause it needs to like grab through it and find something.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, yeah, because, yeah, I see the commands that it's running.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: And, yeah, it's like, amazing that, you know, that it's able to figure out such, grep, nice grep, commands and figure out stuff just from that.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah, cause I look at the syntax too, and I'm like, I had no idea like that's you could pull that stuff out.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Like, so, it's a good way to learn as well.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Do you, when you, so, when you're using these threads, like, you mentioned like one went to like 100 dollars.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Do you know how much of the context window you used for that one?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I don't know if you remember,\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I don't I even compact, I even know, I know if it's compacted or, yeah, I even compacted this thread a couple of times, I think, but I don't remember how much of it I used, but I never used more than 50 percent, you know?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Okay, yeah, cool.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: And, you know, amp starts, starts warning you, I think even sooner, like if you spent like 20 percent or something, it starts saying, yeah, you should compact.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So, so in terms of like context management, and I guess cost reduction techniques, so anything above 200, like we have a 1,000,000 tokens per thread, anything above?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I forgot the number exactly.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Let's say it's like 250,000 in the 200 mark, the tokens, the credits cost a bit more because that's from our, inference providers, the rates go up.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So, while you can use the full thread or even if it's up to 50 percent, that's fine to do as long as it's still giving you value.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Now a technique you can use to get a lot more out of that thread.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Let's say you want to use 20 percent of that main thread is you can use sub agents.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Now, with sub agents, each sub agent has a 1,000,000 tokens, not that you would use all of them, but like let's say you're saying, go to this other code base, go check these things.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: You can just ask amp to go do that in sub agents, and we'll spawn multiple sub agents.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Do these activities come back?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And your main thread might be like two percent still or three percent?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Whereas,\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: normally would have been like 30 percent gone to do all of this stuff.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It's a bit of a hidden feature in the sense that we don't want, amp, knows to use sub agents itself.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But if you know the type of task you're going to do that, it could benefit from it, you just need to ask it to use sub agents.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, I read about sub agents and I remember that, yeah, it uses sub agents automatically, but you can also use it.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: But then, yeah, I left this for like advanced use case.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I didn't get to use it.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, yeah, but okay, that's good to know.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, I guess the agent has smaller context and doesn't bloat your existing context that way.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Because you're using lots of smaller, yeah, lots of smaller sub agents and then you'll just get lots more and the performance is faster as well.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah, the experience all around is better.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: You're saying the more context you use, the more expensive it gets, right?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yes.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, if you,\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: had a thread that cost you 100 dollars straight away, my head goes to like, oh, maybe you use a lot of that context window.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And like if someone's having a bad experience, that's kind of what I've been seeing like, oh, I'm like trying to like figure out this thing or kind of stuck in a loop there's a concept where like the context is polluted, it's just like sometimes it's better to like declare bankruptcy on that thread.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I do this actually.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So it starts just, start fresh.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, I also, yeah, yeah, I just start fresh, but I haven't gotten, you know, maybe I haven't gotten past 50 percent of context for sure.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I think it was more like 30 percent I used or something like this.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Right.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Okay.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: You mentioned like when you were doing the webhook project, you know, you were doing that, you're kicking it off.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: You're test running all these things.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: What are you doing when that's going on?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Like are you working on another task with another amp instance or like how, what's your workflow?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Like.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: It really depends… this task that I spent 100 dollars on.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I didn't leave it.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I was like working on it all the time, the other tasks the first two I mentioned which were good.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I would just leave it to do its work and do some other stuff in between.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I would multitask in this example.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I also.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: with amp, or like just.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: No, just do slack stuff slack and email and, yeah, meetings things like this.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: In any case, even without amp, I multitask too much.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, yeah, fair.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Enough.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Well, there is something I want to show you which is SDK… and I have a SDK plus 50 lines of code.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And what I'm able to do is have three terminals and I have tickets in Jira, and I can kick off some of these tickets with amp.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And these, in these 50 lines of code, it's able to progress the tickets along, create a, do you use git work trees by any chance?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Do you know what that is?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, I know, but yeah, we are, we don't intellij shop.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, yeah, we don't intellij doesn't have a support for work trees.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, we don't use them, but, I know what they are.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Okay.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But even at a git level, you can't use it with intellij.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: It's you would have to switch.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: You would have to open a separate project, you know?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Oh, yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: There you go.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Because git work tree.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: As far as I understand, every branch is it's in own folder, right?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yes, that's right.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, I checked this couple of years ago and intellij didn't have support, for this.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I used neovin myself a lot for a bunch of stuff, but for java, it's not very good for python.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I use it, but for java, it sucks.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, yeah, for that, I have to use intellij.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Because, the thinking is like let's say you have, you know, 10 tasks to do.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Five of them are medium, three of them are easy.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Two of them are hard.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, easy.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Ones just chuck them into this thing I'm going to show you and then you just review the PR.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So it's kind of like simple things that don't need like you want to make sure the code compiles unit tests are passing, but it's not like a big thing that's worthy of your time.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: You should just focus on making bigger tasks.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Let me just quickly show you.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And then you can tell me, okay?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Of relevance.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So what I'll do is I'll show you the code last actually.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So I have these three tickets.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I have this repo.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: This is just like a sample app that, I have it running.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But for the purposes today, I won't show you and I have these three terminals here.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And I'm calling in my example, this script execute agent that's just the name of my script and the ticket id in Jira.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So can one can three, can four.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So let me kick them up.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: You can see here.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It's pulling the repository.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It's creating a branch.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It's starting a thread.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And as you already would know, you can, I can let go and check on these threads on my phone and anywhere it's all on the internet.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I can follow along.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But really these are the type of tasks you don't want to be checking in at a thread level while it's working, you might come back to the thread after it's done.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But let's have a look how this is going.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So here, it's starting.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Oops.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Okay.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So it's fetching the Jira ticket… created a work tree.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Okay.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: This is your script, is doing this, right?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah creating work tree?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I'll talk you through the script shortly.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So it's updating the status to in progress.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I've refreshed the page, some of these.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Okay.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So two of these are in progress.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: If I click into the ticket, it's you know, it's got whatever.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I could add more information into this.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Obviously give it some guidance.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: The thinking is that you break bigger things down into smaller things that are throwable into this unit of work.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: What I want you to take away from today isn't like my system.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It's more that the flexibility of the SDK.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: This is just a common example that every developer kind of goes through and that I've only spent 50 lines of code to achieve this.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So… maybe I'll just skip along.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So if I click on one of these one that I've done earlier, once it's finished it'll, you know, put a description of what the changes are and say that it's tested and unit tests are passing a link to the pull request, a link to the amp thread because some of these things are like, I want you to go research on how to implement this.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And then I want to check like, did you go to the right resources?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Did you pull the documentation from the right thing?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So here, this is a PR.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So it's just adding a sort button, you know, something fairly simple in my agent's MD file.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I have a pull request guidelines.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So that's why this pull request is so high quality.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Okay?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Okay.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: That's not anything special to my thing, but it's more just the guidelines.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But main thing is I can go and review the files.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I could put comments in here.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I can then with the thread id, I could go back to amp and continue with thread using that thread id.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I can switch to that branch and then take over if I wanted to.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But let me show you the code now, which is here.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So the way this works is step one.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I have to import the amp SDK.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Of course, I have a hash map that maps my kanban board to the repo that I'm working in.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So if you have multiple repos, you might want to manage it that way.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Isuru can you just give me a minute?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I need to change the meeting room?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Sure.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: No problem.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Just give me a minute.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: All good.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Hey, sorry for that.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: That's all good.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: No problem.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So you, yeah, yes.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So, we resolved the repo, and then because this is running on my local machine, it has access to everything on my machine.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So, for example, do you use GitHub by the way or?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Something else?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: No, we're on bitbucket.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Bitbucket.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So you could, yeah, I'm saying use the GitHub cli, but you could just say, you know, use the git, you know, the git operations, it'll use.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: The cli whatever.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Exactly.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So if you think of a use case that depends on an internal cli, you can just reference that.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So this is doing all the heavy lifting.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I'm not really managing any of the complexity amp's just moving tickets to in progress like this way.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So fetch the Jira ticket.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And I'm saying use the Jira tool.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So I'll explain that in one second, but I'm just saying change the status to in progress, make, clone the repo, create a git work tree.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I'm saying where to do it, create a branch, start working the solution like whatever your requirements are for your simple units, you just customize that to what you need.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And then you can start pushing work through that.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And with the execute method… all I'm doing is it's going to stream out responses based on the message type.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So if it's a system message, but once it's all done, you'll see a result message type, and then, you know, the execution's completed, either it failed or it's successful.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So really, you can build a lot of use cases off this SDK.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: This is just one example.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: We have other teams who are exploring, like when there's an on call issue, they will first pass it through a system like this that they've built on top of the amp SDK which will pull context from the observability platform, look through git, come up with like just an opinion on where to start investigating.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So things like that is how it works before I go on and show you the toolbox tool.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Any questions so far?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: No, no.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I am interested about the Jira integration.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Okay?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Is your Jira self hosted or it's not?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: No.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: We use cloud Jira, okay.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So cloud bitbucket.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Okay.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Great.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So you could use the MCP server for atlassian if you wanted to.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But there is an annoying thing with the oauth, it just keeps popping up.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So for some of these kind of work, you would have probably experienced that it's like it keeps making you authenticate.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I don't know of a way that you can bypass that with API keys.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But this is a good way solution to put into the amp toolbox.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So what the amp toolbox is?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I've said toolbox, I've said a path and this is a toolbox here.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And I have a Jira tool and this Jira tool.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: We have.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Two things that the Jira sorry, a amp toolbox tool needs to do which is describe itself.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So what can it do?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So, these are the actions it can do.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And then when we execute that tool, what does it do?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And in this case, I can get a Jira ticket, update the status, add a comment and it's just using the standard API for that.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So we have lots of customers who don't want to use the community MCP servers that are out open source, put the API keys into that.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So this is a great way to avoid doing that.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So I have all this code that I can share with you if that's something you want to look at.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And yeah, so this is just 50 lines of code 48.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: If you don't need to use the Jira tool, it'll just be this, but you might think of this is just an example.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So you'll think of better use cases that are realistic to your workflow, that may be helpful.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, I know this is pretty simple.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: 50 lines of code is nothing.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Like a third of it's probably the prompt as well.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: This SDK.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: is probably like two weeks old, maybe.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So, it's something fairly new for us but we're seeing like this is, yeah… this is quite a powerful feature if it's the right people use it and understand what it can do, which is kind of the problem I'm trying to solve which is making sure people can see what it's capable of and just give them some examples to work with.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I guess you have to have first the project ready for this with good agent MD, yes, and well defined jiras and very small jiras probably.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, it's worth… trying.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: In the sense that like if you have a Jira ticket and you might, I don't know if you have subtasks, you can break down a subtask or a bigger ticket and put that subtask in… or it may be too big.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And this isn't the use case for you like that's.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I'm not saying it needs to be Jira, but the trend… that we're seeing like as a field engineer is people's jobs are transforming in that a lot of their effort is going from just breaking down big complex things into smaller things.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And when they're small enough, the efficiencies are just putting that into some other system and focusing on these big complex things.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, I know it's even if human is writing code, you know, I know that if you define smaller tasks, you know, like you said, the project goes faster so that's right?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: But yeah, usually people are too lazy to break it down into small enough things.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: And because opening Jira is hard.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: That's true.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: You'll be surprised in that if the work becomes easier if you break it down, then you have a motivation to break things down if it makes your life easier, right?\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So there is a, but you need a system you can trust that's also the, if you put it through something that's going to make more work for you, of course, it's not worth it.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I will write this on my wall or somewhere that I can read it every day.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, because I see here for example, it's not, this is now unrelated to amp, but I see that majority of people don't take enough time to break down the tasks.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: But yeah, I guess with this, if you want to use this approach that's the only way.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah, it's because as you would know, if you put a big thing into it, the LLM is just going to assume and fill in the gaps and it's probably going to be wrong.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I'll just share the, that's the repo for the code.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: I just showed, you just need to replace the Jira environment variables.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: There's a readme in there that you could use.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But more importantly the amp SDK… because you're one of the rare people who loves a manual.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Which I like.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: SDK has its own manual.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And in my opinion that SDK manual is really good.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It goes through different use cases with example code as well.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Cool.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Good stuff.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah, I guess, yes, because your team's out of credits and you're still using Kodi, are you, do you know if the team is intending to continue with Kodi or will they transition to amp?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I mean, for sure, we will have some AI, but yeah, we're evaluating options now and yeah, you know, it's quite a steep jump from Kodi to amp in terms of pricing.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, I don't know we're now evaluating this.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I'm actually not in charge of this.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, one of my colleagues is, but, yeah, before I think the subscription should expire in a couple of months for Kodi.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So yeah, we'll see.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: We, would, we would love to use amp or some other agentic tool, but yeah, it's just you got.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: To select.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: And also, it's a big, it's expensive.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, because also, you cannot expect everyone… to know how to use it or there will have to be a lot of education, you know, because people just, they don't read the manuals or search online for best practices.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: They just start typing and, you know, do this and yeah, then it doesn't work.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Fix this.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: But then it spends a ton of money.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, yeah, it's a pricing is a problem.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Okay.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: That's fair enough if you do, if, of course, as long as, you know, get into the tool that works well for you.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: That's that's great.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: If you do go with amp, the field engineering team.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So we work on these types of use cases, these automation type things.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So if you end up implementing something with the SDK, we'd yeah, we'd love to work with you and kind of hack on a solution because that's kind of like what we're really interested in.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: We're finding that the use cases that custom like we'll go into a customer presenting something.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Then what comes back is like, well, we did not expect that workflow, it kind of evolves into like something else… cool.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But yeah, there is, a new thing we're experimenting with for some customers.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It's not announced yet, which is to do with like user based… not pricing but like controls user based controls in terms of like setting policies and things like that.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: But yeah, you can talk to, I don't know who you're talking to from my team, but you can have a chat to them about that feature.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: If that ends up being a blocker for you.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Okay.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I'll mention it to one of our guys who is doing it, talking about the contract and related stuff.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, that's for sure.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: If you could set some policies.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, I think that would be mandatory actually.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah, that's fair enough.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Awesome.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Well, yeah, thank you so much for your time.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It was really, nice to meet you.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: And, yeah, it's actually really nice to hear your using everything like the right way.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: So, I was actually really impressed.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Cool.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah, keep up the good work.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I guess this has progressed a lot in the last year, I think, yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah, it's a big jump for Cody.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Yeah, you know?\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: I feel like crippled.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Now when I have to use Cody… it's terrible actually.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: It's like a compliment and a compliment and a criticism in one.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Well, cool.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: So, yeah, take care and keep up the good work, I guess.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Thank you.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: See you later.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Okay.\nSpeaker 311420266252263326: Bye.\nSpeaker 6950543666266883200: Bye.",

Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: My bad.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Sorry about that.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah, I can hear you.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: How are you doing?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I'm doing great.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: How are you?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Great.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Have you heard of the conference lead?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Dev… the, what the conference lead, dev, conference lead dev, New York?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: No, no, I'm not familiar with.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: That is that.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Where you are?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Well, not right now, but I'm in New York for that.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It was yesterday and the day before it was pretty good.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Gotcha.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, cool.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Cool.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: What does that cover?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It's just one of those developer conferences I don't know what particularly they're like focused on, but it's like general software development.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Oh.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It's pretty good.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: We had a lot of good companies swing by and we had a booth there.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I think I'm excited with like a pretty big freaking big announcement because we made, we have like a free version of amp that has ads I saw.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: That?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Oh, you saw that cool?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I saw that?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I got the email.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Oh, okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Got it.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yep.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, yeah, there's a decent amount of buzz around sourcegraph during the event.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, that's pretty cool.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I imagine that'll be that's the type of thing that we get a lot of people to try it out.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah, that's exactly right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I mean, I have like friends and family.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I'm like, hey, just use it to build fun stuff.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It's free.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, that's cool.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So, I'm not sure if Dave's going to make it.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: We've got a pretty busy week over here.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So, question… mark on whether or not Dave will make it, and I forwarded this to John nill this morning when I realized he wasn't already on it.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: We should probably add him to this.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: He's right now kind of doing a lot of the legwork for this amp, trial.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: We're spinning up.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So, he's probably got more information than I do on that at the moment just because he's been pushing… on that.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: He's very motivated to get this trial started.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: John nill.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: John nill.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Have we met with him maybe approved by colleagues?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Know, Sam has met him.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Oh, nice.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I'm not sure he's been in the last couple of these.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, I think it's been a while maybe since the kickoff.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: He was in some of the earliest ones that I was in and then I think he sort of bowed out for a while, so… but he's been, you know, doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: He's one of the admins for our sourcegraph instance as well.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So, he's… up to speed on a lot of it.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Did you saw that we added the free credits?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Was that useful for you all?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I saw the, that we had like, the 10 credits… that you get just… for sort of joining, but I'm seeing our balance for amp, right now is zero.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Oh, maybe that's it to do that we need to work on.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Do you, did?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I don't think I sent you any information about our.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: The workspace name?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, the workspace?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Oh, okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah, I would.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: All right.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Maybe I didn't do that.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Well.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I think it's lutron def electronics, right?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yep.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: That's the one.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Cool.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Let's see how many credits you all have.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Did you… hey, Dave?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Hello?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Hi, Dave.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Did you all talk about that?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: All the swap conversation that we were talking about previously?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I brought Dave up to speed on that a little bit.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So, I think where we are right now is we're gonna do a trial where we're I think we're just gonna buy a 1,000 dollars in credits and get upgraded to the enterprise tier, so that we can get the sso and zero data retention.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: And then we're gonna kind of see how far that takes us.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So I'm hoping that can give us some useful insights, on amp, compared to Cody.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So we're gonna do that before we consider like changing our contract.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I don't think we're quite at the point where… we're comfortable kind of pushing that through.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: The, the cost is like a huge question on that.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So, so, we're gonna try it out and see how far we get.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, I think, remember… I was talking about like the deal minimum of, the five K.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: We were talking about that.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But, it might be fine, but I just wanted to run this, run this by you.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, remember how we were talking about this very partial swap.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: The intention is, you know, just full disclosure.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: The intention is to make sure our customers do move towards amp and are comfortable with that in the move.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But basically, this is your current contract.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Your ppu is okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And if we… need to get to that five K threshold, it does get prorated as I mentioned, with the number of months remaining in the contract which ends on March 20 fifth.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But we have the ability to swap out a portion of your licenses, your Kodi licenses, for amp.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Basically, what I was trying to figure out are your max Kodi mail, which it hits around 212.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But then we, if you have a 1,000 dollar budget, we could decrease the amount that we swap here and increase that figure.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But we could swap it in a way that,, you do hit that five K number with a 1,000 plus four K in the swap figure in, the contract.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So then the Kodi number would be higher than that.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But then you'd have users using amp until March 20 fifth?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: The, and as a reminder, it's prorated is the biggest challenge if there's a world where you all were comfortable with, an early renewal of some sort that would that'd make things easier?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But I'm trying to work with the assumption that won't be feasible.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Right.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So, so the issue is that because it's prorated the longer we wait, the more Kodi users we need to swap over to amp credits to hit five K.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Is that right?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah, that's right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And if you do have a 1,000 K budget, we basically want the contract until March to, you have no impact on like, what you intended the contract to be, but then you have the addition of these amp credits.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Let me get some… thank you.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It's easier on this calculator.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Complex man.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So if you swapped out 40 seats?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: To the attention fraction.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: You need 25 seats?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, if you dropped your Kodi amount to two five… and then had that 1,000, you would be within the range, if that makes sense.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So it dropped to two five, but, the 1,000, yeah, exactly 1,000 that we, that we're planning to spend.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, hopefully imminently, it doesn't look like it's happened yet because we're still on the team tier team plan, whatever you guys call it.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Huh.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: But… doesn't sound like it's gonna take too long to get that done.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So that would count towards that 5,000, right?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yes, correct.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: That's good.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I somewhat need to double check that, but I'm confident that would be the case.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I don't see how it would not be the case.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I said, what did I say?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I said?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Two five.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, your max Cody hit in September, which was 212.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Would you have designated amp users until March?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Do you think you'd have designated amp users?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Think it depends, it depends on how much it costs us to use in practice and how much better it is.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So, like, if the quality to dollar ratio is good enough then we might be willing to, you know, cut more people over.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: But since it's like, it depends like we have use cases where, you know, Cody is not giving us great results.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: And if amp can give us really great results in those use cases, then it might be a matter of, you know, maybe for those people, we designate them as amp users and keep sort of, the general population using Cody.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I don't know it kind of depends on what we learn in the trial to be honest with you.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: And we're okay.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: We're we're kind of trying to design out that trial.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Now, it's kind of early.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, like I'm trying to do the math, well, I think it's three… eight, zero.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: All right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I think I got the math right?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: All right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, I think one thing that we just want to be, hopefully, we conveyed this, but we are vetting everything towards amp, at least from the AI perspective, And that's why we're like trying to do things like the swap because, the nature of like what you're going to get experience wise with Cody.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It'll probably be the same but it'll kind of stagnate over time, meaning all our like engineering like firepower is going towards making amp the best tool available.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, I think when you do the trial, you'll see that it… it's much more attractive in terms of a swap scenario.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But in the interim, if this is like a step we can take where we create a contract, use that one K prorate, five months.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I do need to get this out to you to make sure it's five months because I'm calculating five months until like it's the right, it's a year.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So it's like November, December, January, February, March, five months.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So ideally, we can sort out the swap, to make sure you get that equivalent of five months in credits.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: We have a little bit of a buffer.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But, that could be a good approach.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Did we give you a background on why we completely created amp from scratch versus like trying to continue to improve Cody?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, I think so.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I think, what I recall there is, you couldn't use some of the more powerful features of the models unless you picked one and optimized for that model, right?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: That's that's kind of, yeah, that's exactly right?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So at a very macro, if you think of us like as a company, what we saw is things are getting obsolete very quickly like autocomplete got obsolete by BS code forks, you know, and Cody was kind of like in this bucket as well, with kind of like a rag chat.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And then that got obsolete earlier this year with lab specific agentic tools with basically the ability to do more agentic style coding.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So we needed an architect amp for a high ceiling.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It's kind of the concept and it does revolve heavily around agentic coding, but it also involves our ability to adopt the best models for any given task.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, when we do show you and onboard you onto this trial, what you're going to be able to use amp for?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Is this the powerful agentic coding functionality?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But you're also going to get things like the ability to do incomplete complex analysis with oracle, and then also a completion engine that, we do not charge you for, so you'll get equivalent of cursor, but it's actually performing better and we don't charge you tokens on that.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So that's that alone makes this very, you know, very attractive.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But you'll be innovating alongside with us with how we're like researching which models to use for different tasks.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And that's where amp's going to be really powerful in the future.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: You'll also.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So we, actually, this is available now, but we can work with you on exploring how to how amp can use sourcegraph's search, MCP, since you're a code search customer.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So you will get like we can actually work with you to do that.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It's a more advanced functionality.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: That sounds that sounds like a good thing for us.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It's going to be great, in terms of like stuff we can do, and that's just one MCP.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: The other thing you can do is use our SDK to do automated code reviews, unit test creation.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I'll I can show you the link, but we have an SDK that'll allow you to overlay this if you want to do that.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But step one is kind of looking at amp as the engine for your productivity because it's agenting… coding is where the market's moving towards.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, we want to ramp you onto it, train you up on it and then get your team comfortable using it.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I have two posts here, and I, when you do start using actually, I should send you the link, but have you heard of Mitchell hashimoto, did I mention it previously?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, he, I'll send you the blog post.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I might have sent it to you, but the reason why the blog post is really good is he's actively creating ghosty, right?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: His next startup essentially, and he's saying he's effectively trying to convince people to use agenting coding because he sees how powerful it is.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And it happens that he's using amp because he sees it as the best tool out there right now.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But the blog post is powerful because it shows him, it shows you what threads he's creating.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And he also uses the oracle and I'll show you how he uses the oracle.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, and he's it's not like he's sponsored, he just, he's just trying to show and teach people how to code in the agentic world.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Simon Wilson, co, creator of Django, calls us the most critical independent and terminal coding agent right now.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: All that to say that the momentums around amp, and we can get it in your hands.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Once we get you more comfortable with how powerful it is.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And if, you know, step one is to work on this, we can try to move quickly on that just for the case of the, the credits.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And if you're comfortable with that,\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Well, so, so, at this point, in order to change our contract, I think we're gonna need, we're gonna need to defend that decision, right?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Like when we go to run up the flagpole, we're gonna need to be able to say that we did a trial and these are the results and this is how much it's gonna cost.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: We need to justify that change.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So, at this point, I don't think we're so much looking at, you know, pulling the trigger on the contract update, Dave, you look like you have something you want to add.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: When you're done?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Right now, we're mostly looking at, at… evaluating the tool and comparing it to what we have today, which is Kodi.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: Because the biggest thing in my mind, well, the biggest hurdle for this in my mind is that we don't know how much it's gonna cost, right?\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: Like we have, a very predictable cost structure with Kodi and sourcegraph today, and we don't know if it's gonna be, you know, on par, two X 10 X, 100 X.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: I have, I really have no idea what.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: to expect or cheaper.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: We have no clue, right?\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: Yeah, pretty sure.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: It's not gonna be cheaper, but, yeah.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Probably not depends.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: Kodi's a pretty, a pretty good deal… like, you can see it in that slide, right?\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: It's like 250 bucks a year per person.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: So, yeah, that's or a month, I don't know, got it.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: Yeah, it's we're… in the, like, everything is changing very rapidly and that's a challenge for us because as an organization in these kinds of cases, it's a little hard for us to move that quickly.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: We're still trying to figure out how to move that quickly.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: And there are lots of options out there.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: It looks like amp, is the best one but… yeah, it's gonna, if we have to go back and say, you know, hey, we need, you know, a half 1,000,000 dollars in the budget for this.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: You know, we gotta have something really good behind it.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: And so, we really have to get our hands on it and try it and we don't wanna, we don't wanna like just cut over and then say, well, we hit our budget so nobody can use the tool for the rest of the year when we get like three months in or something.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: You know what I mean?\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: Like, okay, we gotta get, some… data to go off of.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Got it.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, even the, like the hybrid swap option, would not work is that.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: It's it's not a thing we can do like right now.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Like we have to go do the trial first if we come out of the trial, and we're like, yeah, we're gonna do it and, you know, maybe we say we'll take, you know, X number of people and make them designated amp users, then we can do that.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: And then the hybrid swap would make a lot of sense.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: It just, it just depends we have to, and honestly, like we kind of have to design the trial to get the right data that we're looking for.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, in terms of, you know, who we include in the trial.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, let's,\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: let.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: me check with the team on… the one K.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Because it seems like, this hybrid concept where we offer the five K through a swap.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It sounds like that's gonna be really difficult.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I mean, it depends right?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Like, you know, if, in a, if we go do this trial and in a month or a month and a half, we say this is great.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: You know, how many seats do we need to cut over to hit that five K?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Then maybe it's like, okay, sure.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: That number's fine.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Or, or, you know, maybe we treat this, as a, I don't know it's gonna depend, on what makes sense for us.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I think we can talk about those options once we've decided, okay, you know, what makes sense for us?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: All right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I can add, I think… 250 credits to your environment,\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: That'd be great.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah, but I don't know if that'll be enough for the testing.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Are you gonna like you'll need the one K essentially for the testing to get over the hump for like a little bit larger of a swap.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah, maybe you can walk me through what would be ideal for you all.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And then, we can try to execute on that, for the testing phase?\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: I think my understanding of, where the one K kind of comes in is we want to get to the, to that enterprise level where we have the zero data retention like that's?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: And sso, yeah, right?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Like, that's the primary, if we don't have that, we're not doing it like, so like we have to get there, we have to get there.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So we can even start the testing.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: That's really why we're talking about the one K thing because it's not that hard to get, you know, a 1,000 dollars.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: All right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: That's that's really why we did that.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I think, and, the reason why I'm like trying to figure out how to execute on that, I think you can just,\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Let me, let me look into like what we can do, I think our target is try to get you to swap.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So let me see what options.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: We have.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: And, and I get that, like if the tool's better, then cool.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Let's you know, we'll figure out we'll figure out how we can work it, into our process.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: All right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, for the near term, we need to get to the enterprise tier.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Let me, let me, talk with the team on that and see what's the best path.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And then, okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And then we'll try to get that started.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Once, we do have that in place, let's assume that we'll figure that out what's, the next step after that's sorted out.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Do you have an enterprise environment with, you know, a 1,000 in tokens?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Will you have a Sperry type group?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Like, yeah, maybe, we can talk about like, what do you think will be the testing?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Will it revolve around, you just validating the costs won't be too high, for tests or what are you all thinking for criteria?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So, so basically, what I'm kind of considering right now and we're still haven't really designed the trial yet.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: But, you know, I'm looking at finding some power users that can kind of tell us, you know, worst case, what a power user is going to spend on this, which I don't think is going to be hard for us to find.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: We've got some very motivated people.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: And then I want to find some of the people who have not had great results with Kodi so far and get them involved and see so that they can tell us if the quality of the tool is that much better.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: And then based on that, you know, we can try it over some period of time, and evaluate the spend and evaluate the quality and hopefully make a decision based on that.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So, I don't think it'd be a huge group especially if, you know, we're going to keep the number of credits relatively low.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So I don't know maybe a couple 12 people.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I don't expect them all to be power users though.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: The power users, as we talked previously, Kyle, and, when we do the trial, it'll if it's a power user, it'll show the token usage on a daily framework… as insanely high.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And then when you multiply by 250, it'll look like it's way higher than in practice would happen.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So I'm going to, so I'm going to go, I'm going to basically look at, our Kodi metrics, figure out who's using the tool a lot and try to come up with, you know, a rough estimate for, you know, if we assume the same distribution of usage, what does that look like?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Just a rough swag?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I know that I can't just take a power user, multiply it by 250 and say, here's what we expect that would be like worst case.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay, got.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: It not a realistic budget.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: If we can, if I go get approval on this, if we can like give you the upgrade for speed purposes, and then, essentially just front the token cost… instead of we having to do paperwork.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Could that get us faster to, the testing and then the potential swap of licenses?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Sure.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I mean, if that's a thing we can do, then that's definitely an option.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I don't know where John is in the process, of getting, that 1,000 dollars signed off.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I would assume, you know, if and when that happens, we would just add that on top of, whatever credits we have in the account already, which I don't think would be a problem… which, you know, might be zero at that point or might be 250 depends on, you know, whatever, or some other number.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I don't.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: know, yeah, because we're gonna give you 250 and there'll be an upgraded account so effectively, you could start on, start this process on Monday.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I think getting sso set up, you know, any guidance you can give us, on how we would execute that would probably help because I imagine that would be, the next roadblock for us.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Got it.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Let's, let's make that the next step.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So we'll just get you started with, the credits that we already have and get your environment to that enterprise raid.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So you get sso, so we can move this along and then, how long do you, anticipate us in the testing?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: You said a month roughly?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Maybe give or take, you know, if we get, if we get amazing results in the first two weeks, then maybe that's enough.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Depends.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Can we, I'll get a solution engineer for the, do you want to do like a kickoff of sorts on how to use it?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: If you think that's helpful?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, I mean, to what extent?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Is it different in terms of how you would use it?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: To, what extent?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Is it different from Kodi?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Like to the point where we would need to train people on it?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, it's Kodi is just like chat and completions, so they need to get more comfortable using agentic, and a, the agentic framework of like coding.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, and also, there's like more advanced features like when to call on the oracle to do something.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And I think something like that would be helpful.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I think at a minimum, a Q a plus demo will be a, good starting point.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Sure we.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Can do that.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Would you want to do that next week or, you still need to like get the group together?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So, I think we need to get the group together, and next week, we're doing, our massive planning session.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So it is a, an uncommonly bad week to try to schedule literally anything.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So I'd say, if we were going to do that, probably the week after would be more appropriate.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Now, if we can get people set up and started on this, then, you know, I'm willing to just turn some people loose and, yeah, yeah, that.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Actually is better.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, just so that we don't need.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: to, so then we can do a Q a.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, then, yeah, you might be able to kind of get things moving and then, yeah… yeah, that's a good idea.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Q a might be, a good way to do that.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It is designed to be like, kind of like self serve.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So then maybe, the demo is more of a Q a if they have questions and then we can show more advanced things.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: All right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Let's let's do that.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, you don't we don't use slack with you.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: All right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: No, it's email.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah, we use teams internally.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So, all right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Let me loop in a solution engineer, get your sso set up.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: If you can get, start inviting team members into that environment.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Does it.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So the 1,000, is that like something you're gonna be taking care of?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Or if, as I mentioned, what if we fronted that for speed?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I don't think that it's gonna be a problem for us to get the 1,000.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I'll ask John right now?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Is there a scenario where you'd, keep… your 250, but then you see the value of amp, and then you just buy credits on top of that or you'd want to?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Swap?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, it's possible totally possible.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I mean, if we find, you know, in the trial that we have a lot of success with amp, for very specific use cases, then that could be a, you know, a use as needed kind of tool.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I don't know that, that's how that's gonna go though.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Got it.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, I think.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It's so this actually, the better question, is the swap interesting?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I'm assuming it is interesting because then you'd be swapping over to, okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Cool.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I mean, if we've got, you know, some people that are working on the types of technologies where amp is just, you know, step change better in terms of, you know, output quality then yeah, they probably wouldn't have much need to use Kodi anymore and just cut them over.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: That'd.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Be my guess.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Got it.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: Quick question.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: Yeah.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: And you may have said this already or you may have answered it in other conversations, but is there a way to look at our Kodi usage and make any kind of association to… how many tokens would that correlate to in amp?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: They're pretty different in terms of products.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I think we can try to, I can try to see if we do have token usage numbers for Kodi, right?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: But I don't know if that's apples to apples in terms of when we do that comparison.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Well, I mean if it could get us in.\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: The.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: if it could get us in the ballpark, that might still be like a useful talking point, right?\nSpeaker 585501475587193349: If it's in the same aisle of the produce department, then maybe.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Let me.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: because right now, the conversation goes something like there's this tool we hear is great and we have literally no clue how much it'll cost and they're like I.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: see.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: You're crazy like you have to give us something to go on.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So if we could at least have like a ballpark number and say it's not exactly the same but here's broad strokes the order of magnitude that this thing would cost us, that would, I think go a long way.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I'm hoping that, you know, the trial will tell us something useful as well.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: But again, it's hard to really predict what the real world spend would be because it depends on who you include in the trial and what they're working on.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So like even that, I don't really expect that to, you know, cleanly scale up, you know, kind of linearly with users.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So even that's really supposed to get a ballpark.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Let me look into that.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I'll pose that question to our team.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And yeah, if I do have something I'll get back to you.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: All right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: So in the meantime, I will try to loop in my, or loop in my solution engineer.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It sounds like you're working on the 1,000 and then.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I'll add the 250, and then if you can add your team members and they can start using that 250, then that'll be a good blend.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: We might, we might want to get the enterprise plan upgraded.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Before we start pulling in more users just so that, you know, we can, you know, make sure we've got sso in place and the zero data retention thing is kind of a big deal for us too.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Okay.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: So that would be kind of a prerequisite for, before we start pulling in more users.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: And I also have to still go figure out who I'm going to even ask… which will probably have to be a next week kind of task for me.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: I,\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: gotcha.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: But yeah, that's definitely those would be the next steps I think.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: And if we need to cover that 1,000, I don't know if the 1,000 would take away from a hypothetical five K investment of any sort.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: If that's the case.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: If there's like a path to like the minimum number, then I think we'd probably just front the 1,000, right?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Because it's like below that deal minimum.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Like is it taking out of some budget that could hypothetically be allocated in the future to a true deal where we use an order form and then execute on the five K?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Do you know what I mean?\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I think so.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I think I see what you're saying like are we?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Taking budget out of because the budget numbers aren't too high, right?\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: It's like one K versus five K.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Yeah, it's not a huge deal.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I mean, it's like there are a lot of different ways that could go, you know, once we decide what we're going to do and it's possible.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: We just say, you know, here's a po for 5,000 dollars in credits and we'll prorate… I don't know, man.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: I think we're going to have to, we're… going to have to figure that out.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Okay.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: All right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Well, in the meantime, we will get you going and then try to schedule office hours on the week after next.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Sounds good.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: All right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Sounds good.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: All right.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Thanks.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: All right.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: Thanks so much.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: See you.\nSpeaker 4194167051568907292: Bye, see you.\nSpeaker 8303148100250594018: See you.",

4817492485698149690: How's your week been so far?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Busy.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah, same here.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Seemingly doesn't stop, but, you know, I've got the light at the end of the tunnel with the holidays coming up.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So, yeah, a few more weeks and we'll be on our way.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah, sorry, I saw your email like, I guess 30, 40 minutes ago, and responded just with regards to adding like the full data to the dashboard that we have internally.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: It's a pretty big, just in terms of like logistics.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: It's a pretty big lift.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So I figured we could start with kind of like a short presentation from a member of our analytics team.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I don't know if it'll be Dan or Kelsey or both of them.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Okay?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: If you have any questions and kind of go from there, if that sounds okay.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Perfectly fine.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I mean, I think just generally, we obviously need to be able to track the units that we're being billed against, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So at some point we're going to need to get visibility into that, but we can take it a step at a time that's fine.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And yeah, I think we had like a few creative solutions there potentially that we could walk through.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Okay?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: But, yeah, Kelsey, do you want to, thanks for joining by the way?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Do you want to like quickly introduce yourself?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And then we can maybe get started.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I think let's maybe pause for a second.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I think Antonio on our team is going to join as well.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Okay, great.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Let me ping him, oh.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Oh, there's Dan.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So it's both of them.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Awesome.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah, perfect.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And let me ping Antonio.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Oh, there he is.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Cool.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Hey, Antonio.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I think you're on, yeah, you're on mute.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Unfortunately… okay, happens to the best of us.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Hello, everybody.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Happy Friday.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Happy Friday.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Cool.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I was talking to serge just a moment ago and figured like I'd let Kelsey and Dan introduce themselves.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Then we jump into some of the kind of my metering metrics as described in our last conversation and over email, I know Dan has to drop partway through the call.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So definitely want to get this out of the way first, and then we can kind of continue the discussion on, you know, the true op and the quote for next year, if that makes sense.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Sounds.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Good.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Sounds good.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I'll go first.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I'm Dan, I'm our head of finance operations here at sourcegraph.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I've been in the company for almost a decade.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Now.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I manage our data and analytics team which is responsible for data collection, recording, tracking, and billing metering.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And so, yeah, I'm here to help, you know, answer the questions and sort of guide the conversation as much as I can.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Yeah, ultimately, a lot of this is, you know, a… getting into the weeds and the details, but also at the same time, there's a lot of high level just sort of understanding and communication about how the plan itself works and the philosophy behind it that's probably worth aligning on.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: So, happy to start either at the low end or the high end, whatever you all are more interested in.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I'll let Kelsey do next.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: I'm Kelsey, I work on the analytics team here.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: So I'm happy to help kind of dive into any details that we need to, but I've been here for about a little over four years now.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Awesome.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Cool.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Serge, what would be like most helpful here?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I know like we covered a bit over email, would it be helpful to reiterate some of those points and then dive in?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Maybe let me help establish the context of why we're having this conversation.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So we did a download of all the events for each of our users over the last year or so.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And what we're finding is that the actual number of active users is somewhere in the vicinity of 500 versus the six, something that you guys are reporting in the dashboard.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And so, what came out of that conversation as Sam said, well, the events that you are able to get an extract from the system doesn't actually cover all of the events.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And then we said, well, we kind of need to know what the events are if we're being charged for them, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And so that brings us here today and effectively, we'd like to understand what are the other events that users are triggering… to be identified as active users?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Number one?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And number two is how do we get access to that data, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Obviously, we need to be able to have access to it and be able to crunch through it for our purposes.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Makes sense.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And yeah, this is a great conversation.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: We, we have this, we get this question once in a while, the important thing to know… it's trying to report on a set of specific metrics.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Not just here's, a comprehensive list of everything you can do in sourcegraph, you can, you know, number of page views, number of logins, those aren't particularly interesting metrics.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: So we don't put all of those into the report because we find it the most valuable things.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: The things that we tie to value, the things that we tie to, you know, our calculator of like hours saved dollars, saved metrics.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Ultimately that those are the things that we put into the download, its number of searches, its number of code intelligence actions, its number of batch changes merged, and so on.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: So you hopefully, that makes sense that the report itself is intended to be capturing some of those bigger things.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Some of those things that, you know, we report on in terms of the sort of value, the value metrics that said, the way our pricing works is not that, you know, you only pay if you do some minimum number of these specific set of six actions.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: The way the product works is if you log in a given month, then you're a billable active user, our belief, you know, formed over many years of talking to customers and using the product ourselves is that value comes from many different places and people sharing a link to the product, other people clicking through that link, browsing around a few pages, looking at the files, clicking on a link to a search results page, for example, someone else ran the search.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And then you click to the link of results that's still value at the end of the day.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And those actions of viewing those results, viewing the output of that search still counts as a billable active user in a given month, we document what makes a user active?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Per our definition of monthly active users.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I think I'll try and find that.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And in fact, that was one of my questions is as I was flipping through the documents, I couldn't find anything that defined.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Mau… and I'm wondering if I don't see, I don't know if this is a question to you is if you can flip through the documents and point my eyes towards that?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Let me find this for you.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Remember that.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: There we go.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: So the page I think that Kelsey shared is more about our analytics platform, but let me share our actual definition of billable usage.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Here's the page.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Let me find a subheader.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I'll just share the screen and I'll share the link as well.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Okay.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Here's the link… and here is the screen.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: So if you go to how are active users calculated for sourcegraph code, search and code intelligence platform, our definition is a billable active code search or code intelligence platform user is signed to and accessing sourcegraph.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: This is included but not limited to visiting a sourcegraph web application or using a browser extension editor extension, or other client while signed in, conducting a search, hovering or navigating code, viewing a file, viewing a repository, creating viewing or receiving a code monitor, creating viewing, modifying or applying a batch, change, code insights and more.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: But it's not limited to just these actions.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Ultimately, the definition is someone who's signed into and accessing a sourcegraph product, someone who chooses to visit a sourcegraph product while signed into the product.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: We do show reporting in the sourcegraph analytics page of that we don't show every possible user action.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: We don't have code monitor creation, code monitor, viewing code monitor being sent.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: There's just hundreds of potential actions that we could list in there for different user activities.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: We list a handful of valuable sort of summary metrics like number of searches that were run and so on.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: You can use it via the API and more.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: But we don't list out every possible user action.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Yet, hundreds of columns in your export spreadsheet, if we were to do that.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Dan, how do we get?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Ultimately?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: What we're trying to figure out is who… are the active users and how are they using the system?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And have they taken full advantage of their system or if they're casual users that perhaps can be using something else?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Yeah, right.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So to that point, what we're looking for is a pretty comprehensive view of well… effectively a complete view of how you guys are counting users, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So you're saying it's 620 something or other, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So there must be a system that is a counter that says, serge logged in.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Therefore he's an active user this month, but the next, you know, last month he didn't log in.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So he's not an active user, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So you must have all that data saying somewhere, the question, is, how do you guys, how can you guys expose that to us?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: So that we can certainly share the full list of users and we can show a counter of all, you know, billable actions in a month or number of days active or things like that.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: If you'd like I will say though that the actual list of user events are not necessarily human readable and understandable lists.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: They're sort of code named in many cases.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And so you're not necessarily going to be able to see like, oh, this user did, you know, action, you know, code dot references dot, you know, I mean whatever like they're not necessarily human readable things.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And so us going in and sort of tagging everything for you.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: It would certainly take some time there's a reason we aggregate these into sort of a handful of buckets, the analysis we ran.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And also, of course, a product is evolving quickly.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And so, you know.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So if we were, if we were to come back and say, hey Dan, we need to audit the number of users that you guys are reporting.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Yes, how would you, how do you respond to that?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I mean, I'm sure we're not the first client to ask for that data.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: The export, the CSV export is typically the way we do this.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And I see that 517 users had numbers in your report for the month and 628 total users showed up in that month.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: So about 18 percent appeared with all zeros in there.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: We certainly can provide a specific list of those users which I guess you already have the list of those users.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: We've done some sort of, we picked a handful randomly and shown you some examples of what they did.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: We can share a longer list and just sort of have a, you know, an output spit out of encoded event names.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: If you'd like we can talk through any number of them, live with you.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: If you'd like if you want to randomly pick user ids, we can go pull them up and walk you through them, but I don't think it's I don't think there's going to be an easy export.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: We can give you that's going to say like, you know, on your side, this user, you know, passed my mental bar as to what a valuable user action was versus not, right there's going to be some level of subjectivity there that we can't necessarily provide you a report.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Is that is going to answer that you?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Don't you don't need to do that.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: We're not asking you for that input.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I think what we're asking you for is what events occurred across our user population that caused them to be counted as an Mau?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: They signed, they active access the site or signed in?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Well, what else did they do?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Did they access the site every day?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Did they do a 1,000 searches a day or did search just log in and then log out and then do a thing?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Yep.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: So.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: That's that's what I need to get to.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Yeah, absolutely.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I think, you know, I'm trying to think of how we can give something that's actually useful here that's not just a bunch of like code names, well?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: You guys have a dictionary for the events, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So, if you have 100 events even if they're in code, there must be a dictionary somewhere to say this is what these are, right?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: We have them categorized.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: So, billable, non billable, active, non active products the product is associated with.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And so we have various categories that we, that are obviously associated with each event.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And we keep this continuously updated but not like a human readable description of all of them.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Let me, we'll work on trying to get some sort of report that gives you like more visibility into this.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I'm sure.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: We can just give you the export.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I suspect they're going to be readable enough that you'll be able to get a sense for them.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: We'll go generate something to give you here so that you can look at it.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: But, and if you have questions, you can follow up with us, I suppose if that works for you.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I mean, ultimately, we need to tie the numbers into what you guys are telling us are the maus and the monthly basis, right?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: So, yeah.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: With whatever that report is, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And if there's a bunch of activities that are non billable, meaning they don't count as a contribution towards the Mau status.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I don't particularly need to see them, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I only care about the events that trigger an Mau status.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Absolutely.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Yeah, we'll take a look at the report, make sure it's not like totally impossible to digest, but we can get you something that hopefully has is understandable.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Yeah, we'll get you that.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I think it's important to, I do want to pull the conversation up a little bit from the report.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: You know, obviously in any given month, someone absolutely will click on a link, go look at a page and then close the window and that'll be it.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And that person in that given month will count as a monthly active user for billing purposes because they signed into the site, they opened a page, looked at a file that was sent to them as a link, whether it's search results, whether it's a page, whether it's a repo page, who knows whatever it may be, and then close it, and that will count as a billable active user in the month.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: There absolutely will be some number of users who qualify for that.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: In the report.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I don't know what the percentage is going to be.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Is it five percent?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Is it one percent?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Is it nine percent?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I don't know, but I'm sure you'll see that in there.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: But ultimately, the way we count active users will still include those users, but only on the months when they do it because we have monthly billing or monthly active user accounting.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: We start from zero at the start of every month.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: If a user consumes an active user seat in that month, they have to actually proactively do that.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: They have to come to the site, view it, use it.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And then in order to count for a given month, so deleting like a user account won't actually, you know, quote unquote, you know, solve this or keep them out.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: They can always just come back the next month.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: It's really only if someone actually chooses to visit the site, will they be counted in any given month?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Understood.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I mean, I think that's a second order of work that we need to do, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Is we have to determine that, say, hey, if surge visits sourcegraph once a month, stays on there for three seconds and then leaves, surge should not have a sourcegraph account… right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Because he's not gaining any value from it.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I think our debate not getting any value from it depends on the page he viewed depends on what he did on that page.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: He got a question.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: He got an answer.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Again, that is the second order of discussion, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I mean, the first order of discussion is how big is this population, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Who are the active people, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So we're looking at the data and there's a bunch of folks who, you know, half of the population is casual… what I would call casual users.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: They have very few transactions, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And so a big part of the question for us is should those people have these accounts?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And internally, we're working through that conversation, but it isn't clear that a, they're getting a ton of value from it or B that we're getting the Roi off them having access to sourcegraph.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I would encourage you to look at multiple months of data for any individual user.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: If somebody doesn't sign in a month, of course, they wouldn't be billed for that month.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: But even if someone only signs in one time in October, they may sign in 30 times in September or zero times in September and not even count as a billable user in September.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: It is a challenging exercise given our active… user based billing is more generous.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: From the perspective of you only get billed.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: If you actually use it, right?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: You don't get billed for just occupying a seat for a year, never actually signing in.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: But from the other perspective, it does mean that it becomes harder to look at a given period of time, whether that's one day, one week, one month, and say, oh, this user doesn't deserve the ability to access it anymore because they didn't use it in this week or this month.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: So just want to warn you in advance that you're probably going to have people then try to sign in the next month and someone else won't sign in the next month.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And do you swap their seat, you know?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: So it's a hard question.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: The challenge we have is if you look at the data, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And I think it's actually shown in your own dashboards.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Is our daily active users are somewhere around 200, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So that's you know, whereas… the monthly user count, the maus are in the low 600, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So that isn't terrific.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: The average user uses it 10 days per month.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: In that case, that's how often you know, I would say, I will say that, you know, a single visit to the site can be well worth well, more than a single visit to the product can be worth well more than the cost of a user seat in a given month.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I think we feel maybe confident in the value that sourcegraph delivers for people who actively use the product.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: No, I'm not surprised to hear that from you.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I think that part of that is sort of the second order of discussion that we need to have internally is where do we draw the line?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Of course, but.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: We need data, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So, you know, the first level of analysis, we see a big gap between what we're seeing as active versus what you're reporting as active, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And so we need to close that gap to zero.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And so, this is the purpose of this conversation, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And obviously, there's additional discussion that follows it.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I do think that you're going to, yeah, that totally makes sense.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I understood.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And I get the desire in general to keep costs as low as possible and make sure that you're getting a positive return on everything you're working on everything you're investing in.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: The way the product works is we try to make it accessible to everybody so people can get that value when they need it.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: But they're only getting billed when they actually get value out of it when they actually use the product.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And so, our monthly active user billing model is designed to save you money because you're not getting billed for people who don't use it in a given month.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I would caution you that if you go in and start to say because in the month of October or September, these users were active more than three times, they count as people who deserve to use the product.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: And these other people do not, you're going to see trouble next month.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: When the person who signed in three times in September decides, oh, I don't need it this month, but someone else does need it.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: You'd be net zero on cost, but you're going to have to deal with internal demand changing there.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Understood.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: It might be worth mentioning as well.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I finally actually got the chance to meet hudson today.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I'm relatively new to working with factset.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: He did mention that I was kind of asking.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So in the coming months in the coming year, what is your position on growth?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah, you know, the opposite of growth.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And the word that stuck out to me was organic.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: You know, he mentioned that they're not necessarily looking to remove users or add users.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: You just kind of want to let it flow.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And we have seen a fairly modest, but I guess you could say organic increase in usage from the first month of the contract in 20 23 to present.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So I just wanted to caution that it does seem like there is internal demand and that also might be represented by the I believe 1900 user accounts that currently have access to sourcegraph which is different than a monthly active user who is again like signing in using the product in a given month.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So those users might come and go depending on the demand and what their current needs are at any given time.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: But there is still like a, every month there are 606 140 users actively using sourcegraph in a given month out of that 1900 user base.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So just wanted to bring that up as something that we covered briefly.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Fair enough.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Just for transparency, there's definitely 600 people using the system every month.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I think the question is how active are they?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And that's the word.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And again, this is more internal, but I think it's helpful for you guys to have some insight as to what's going on this side of the wall, if you will.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: In terms of looking at this right hand and, you know, part of this is because we have a mandate to manage costs and deal with it.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: You know, two years ago that wasn't the environment, but the environment has changed, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And so it is what it is, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Just stepping back a little bit, Dan, can you set our expectations on when we should expect to see the data?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: We'll pull something and like make sure it's understandable.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Hopefully we should be able to send something over by Monday.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: I don't think that should be too tough.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Is that reasonable on your side?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Let's talk.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: about it a little bit internally and make sure that it's not going to be like sending over a cryptic, you know?\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: So we'll get back to you that's, my hope is Monday, we'll work through Sam on that.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Perfect.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: OK, perfect.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I think the only other, I think this is probably a good place to pause the data discussion.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I think the only other point… of discussion Sam that we had was on the unit price and we began this conversation.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I think in the last call and… where are we on that?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And Dan Kelsey, if that's kind of the conclusion of the data side, feel free to drop, appreciate your presence.\nSpeaker 1926666167483683006: Thanks guys.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: OK.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yep.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Cool.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: All right.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So, yeah, thanks for bringing that up.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So… I spoke with our finance team and proposed keeping one year flat.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I think the last time we spoke, we mentioned one year flat or two years flat renewal.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I know that you are seeking a further discount on the price per user per year.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Our finance team looked at the historical increase in the account and they would like to adhere to the previous contracts like verbiage relating to that.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I think it's a seven percent increase per year.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So, our proposal as it stands today is a one year at a modest seven percent increase or a two year agreement at a completely flat renewal rate.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So there'd be no change to pricing at all.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: OK.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: How does that square up with our request for price reduction?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And it's a good question.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And again, I asked, you know, given that I mentioned that either would be flat, I asked for that, I wasn't able to get it.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I was able to do two years flat, one year at a modest increase regarding the discount that you're seeking… again.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Like I think it's worth reiterating that you folks are probably like one of the lowest paying price per user per your customers that we have you're very far below our, again, I think I mentioned this on our last call at our floor price by a substantial margin.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And because of that, we're not able to offer a further discount.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I would truly like love to give you more wiggle room on the price, but our finance team is very firm that the lowest price we can offer is the current 279 if you were to pursue a two year deal.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I don't think we're looking at a two year deal.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I mean, we'll take that back to the team and have that conversation, but I don't think this is something that was on the table.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: The… the 279 is problematic, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: It's 279, is roughly 52 percent discount.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: There are, very few enterprise deals that are done at 52 percent discounts, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: That's that's just completely out of the norm on the low end, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So, most software deals are, you know, SaaS deals are somewhere in the 80 percent range.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And so, the question… to you is, how do we, how do we escalate this competition up, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Because I think the feedback that you're giving us is a hard one to accept.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I mean, I think on one hand there is, you know, the percent number is a bit arbitrary, the pricing that you currently have as.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: A software pricing?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Well, yeah, exactly.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Right.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: But I mean, specifically, like, you know, throwing out like a 50 percent or a 60 percent or a 70 percent because the contract previously based on our old pricing model was in fact 70 percent.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: As it stands today, our pricing has changed.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: It is now a 50 percent discount because.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: prices.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yep.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And so… because of that, you know, we're happy to offer a flat renewal at the current rate which was satisfactory during the last renewal period… but it's been, it's.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: not satisfactory, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So that's the issue.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Can I ask what's changed internally?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Is this, is this something that's related to fact sets?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Like cash flow?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Is it related to a deal?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: But I guess I'd love to learn more about that, if that.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: We're we're taking a closer look at all of our contracts, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And we're being extrajudicial about how we think about how contracts are priced and how to what extent they are competitive in a market space, particularly given fact sets, name and sort of stature in the industry, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And so what we're finding and Antonio and I have this conversation five times a day, I think.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: But what we're finding is there's a lot of room for improvement of pricing with a lot of contracts, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And, you know, we're having the very same conversation we're having with you today, you know, we're doing this, you know, times 100 with other vendors, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So… you know, it's a different environment like you said, two years ago, this probably would have been signed off without a blank, but it's not two years ago, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And there is focus on costs and we're looking at the contract 50 percent discount rate on the enterprise deal is pretty terrible.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: You know, I call that the surge price, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So the surge works into the off the street.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And once it wants to buy a couple of licenses, that, that's effectively what surge would get, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: We think that that's that you get better pricing than surge.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Sure.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: If you look at our stock as well, you could see that we are, we do need, you know, it's been a rough road for us in the last this past year.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: And we go through a lot of software optimization meetings where we're trying to figure out where can we consolidate that?\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: And so the better light that we could put in with sourcegraph.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: The more it goes under the radar.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: I would, you know, that's the feedback I would give management because if not, then it's just something that we just tag and to review for potential consolidation.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: So that's all.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Sure.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I was going to say oftentimes we find it's helpful to bump this up to.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I don't know what your structure is if you have a VP or rvp or you go up directly to your CRO, but oftentimes it's helpful to get those conversations get going.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And I don't want to delay this because I do, I think there is a notice period.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah, that's right.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I believe the negotiations have been moved up to November fourteenth.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So we've got a little less than a month.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I'm with you on that.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Like obviously like want to make this work with you and to your point on the environment changing totally understand like money is more expensive, interest rates still higher.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Like I don't know, are they going to come down?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Maybe we'll see, right?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And you know that I would say that does cut both ways.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: You know, like what might be fact sets, problem with requiring a lower rate could be in fact sourcegraph's problem with requiring a higher rate.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So we feel that a flat two year renewal is advantageous to both sides.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I do take your point that, you know, reviewing this again with our finance team and I can tell you a little bit more about the structure.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I, we have a deal desk team that lives within finance, you know, they approve, they reject, they modify every customer quote that we send out.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I'm happy to take this back to them and see if we can make an adjustment here.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I can't guarantee that.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And because of that for right now, like I unfortunately, I have to remain firm at the 279 86.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I don't think 279 is going to work, candidly, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So I'm trying to avoid, you know, a… level of frustration that comes with, you know, us pushing in opposite directions, which is why I suggested, you know, we often get into the deal desk and sort of, you know, my description of deal desk is typically is where good deals go to die.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So sometimes they're helpful.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Sometimes they're not right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I don't know how yours is, you know, but in general, deal desks are not particularly helpful.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Oftentimes we need somebody with authority to step in and say, I get the situation, I'm going to override them.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And so that's our ask, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Is certainly go back to the deal desk.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I think 279, is unworkable.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: You know, again, our perspective is I'm going to pull up my spreadsheet?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah, because I would be curious.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I'm sorry for interrupting.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I would be curious to like from your perspective, understand like, what is workable?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Just so I have numbers on my plate, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Absolutely.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So that's what I was looking up.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So 80 percent discount gets us to roughly 120, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So you've got 280 in the table.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So we're pretty far apart… right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And so this is the challenge, of the 50 percent discount, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: It's so far out of sync with industry pricing.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Yeah, it creates a big gap.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah, I hear you.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: That number… sounds very at first glance, sounds unrealistic unfortunately.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And what I'll probably do is create, you know, the… go from the one year agreement at 299 45 and bring that down to something that's more agreeable percentage based because historically like that has been the price increase.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Again, like I think that the 279… is advantageous.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: But I, you know, I think we're kind of talking in circles a little bit.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So your point is well taken that, you know, this is brought back to my team for further discussion and remitting that back to you.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: But again… I think it's worth just saying over time that there's there aren't promises… that I can make like right now on this call today, I understand.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I completely appreciate that, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And I know at some point things get out of your control and you don't have authority to give us 120, which is the reason why I'm asking for an escalation up to whoever holds the pen on this, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And, and ideally, that's not the deal desk, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Because they are balanced certain standards as well, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So they don't particularly hold the pen to anything either… right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So, I think that's the next step that's our ask is if you can run this up the chain and have this conversation, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I mean, I think, and part of this obviously is going to influence, you know, to what degree are we going to push the envelope on the number of users versus, the price, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: And, as the price stays high, we're going to be a lot more vigilant about the number of users we have in the account.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: If we get closer to our 120 number on the unit price, we're probably going to be a little more relaxed on, how aggressive we get on reducing the number of users in the system?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yep understood.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And, you know, I'd respond to that and say that again, like it's there are going to be questions raised, if the number of users the Mau, is decreased, so that might in effect result in a higher unit price.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So, I just wanted to call that out because again, that's something that's going to have to go through deal desk, go through, you know, whoever the powers that be are for approval.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And I wouldn't be surprised, if that is marked up.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So I just wanted to call that out.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: I mean, we should start with the base case, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: The base case being where we are today and then go from there.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: But, I think looking at the data, it's going to be pretty hard to see how the user count doesn't come down, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: The only question is how far does it come down, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: It's it's probably not going to be 600.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Maybe it's somewhere closer to 500 or somewhere in between, or maybe it's closer to about two or 300, right?\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So, I don't know but let's start at the point that we all know which is where we are today, and we can tweak pricing from there.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Awesome.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah, that sounds great.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Well, yeah.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Happy to get started on all this soon after this call here.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And then we can, I think we can probably communicate on Monday along with some of the analytics feedback that Dan and Kelsey are going to prepare for you.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: If that sounds like an, OK plan.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: That's perfect.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: So we'll expect some feedback from you on pricing on Monday.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Sure.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: And do you want to set up another meeting on the calendar?\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Should we wait until we have that?\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Put something on?\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: I think it's a good idea to put something on.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: OK, yeah.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: A little bit nicer to go through.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: We're all here now, we can figure out in a good time at the same time.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Sam.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: I'm also going to be sending you a quick email just for some other housekeeping things about asking for, just if you can provide me with like a order form without commercials just so our legal team can review the current… terms that you have on there.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: And also… some other things such as our legal team has been asking for us to remove any auto renewals that's the request.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yep.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: That's I know we talked about that last week.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah, we did.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: OK.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah, especially since we're going to have a conversation probably every year anyway.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So might as well just strike that.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: That's something I can do for you.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: OK.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: I'll send it on email just so I know because I don't think I sent the other one on email.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: I think we just talked about it maybe, but I'll just put it in writing real quick and we'll go from there.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: You can respond.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: OK, yeah.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Perfect.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: So in terms of another meeting, my calendar is fairly open next week.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Afternoons would be great if that works with you any particular day, I could recommend maybe Tuesday or Wednesday?\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Yeah, either one's fine by me.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Oh, wait.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Let me see.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Wait.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: This is next.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Oh, no.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Say like Wednesday at two that's OK?\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Yeah, that's good for me Wednesday.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: At two.\nSpeaker 8753308363527612703: Yeah, that works.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: OK.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: If we need to edit this, let me know.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Happy to move things around.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: OK.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Great.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: I will send this to you after this call… but, yeah, I'll take all this back to my team.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: We'll update you on Monday and we'll go from there.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: OK, fantastic.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Appreciate it.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Good.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Thanks.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Both.\nSpeaker 4817492485698149690: Have a good weekend.\nSpeaker 2509764495638238206: Bye bye.",

Hello, Christopher.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Hey, how's it going good, yourself?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Good… mr.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Rainey.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Mr.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Lamb?\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: How's it going guys?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Hello?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Good.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Eric, did I read this, right?\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: That you're on the other side of the world right now?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah, I.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: am, what time is it there?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: It is one a M.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Oh, boy.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: We appreciate you.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: On the other side of the world… but gotta do what you gotta do.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: You're in Korea, right?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Very jealous.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: It is.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Seattle is like officially Seattle.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: We, today was our first today was our first day of like not just having the greatest weather like perfect fall, 60 degrees every day.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I think it says on the forecast, 12 straight days of like 100 percent coverage of rain, so.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: All of a sudden, it goes from like a 14 hour days of sunshine to like six hours of sunshine.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I know like overnight.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Somehow, I know all of that says it's supposed to happen like a couple minutes every day, but it just happens.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I was talking to Ryan Carson, who was here.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: We did one of the dinners, one of the cab dinners and he sent me a text and he was like, this is the greatest weather, Seattle's this is the best thing ever.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Like, well, two days from now, you won't be singing the same song as soon as the rain comes.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Ronnie, how are you?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Doing well, Tom, how are you doing?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Good, good.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: All right.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, we've got Chris on the call and did anybody else accept from our side?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Tom?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: It's kind of weird like each one of us can only see our acceptance.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: We can't see what the rest have done.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Oh, interesting.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah, there were a lot of forwards.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Let's see Becky accepted.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay, perfect.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Ron and Russ came, did not accept.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Okay, I thought I got a few other accepts.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Chris, probably, Chris is on the call.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Chris is on.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, yeah, while we give while we give Becky me, Russ a minute to join Chris.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay, I'll ping them, probably just lay out what we were thinking about for this call, Tom and then from an agenda perspective, and then we can kind of, you know, revise if needed and go from there.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So I think I believe you've spoken to Becky a couple of weeks ago.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So Becky and kaim are the account managers on the blackstone account.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Becky's the account manager, kaim's like more of a client partner if you will overlooking blackstone and a couple of other accounts and what we thought we could do a few things.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: One is, of course, we had shared some names with you as to the stakeholders that we are involved with.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: But looks like there was no overlap which could be good because it would be good to see like other areas where you are involved with at blackstone and see if there are any collaboration opportunities.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So that's one.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And the second thing is that Russ, he so so nuevo which is a product that we built out for, the Aws partner demo competition.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: In fact, Chris was a key member of the team that built it out.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Russ, sort of refactored it using amp.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So we would want, we wanted to kind of just show it to you guys just to sort of show you tell you a bit about the product and as well as or maybe it's more of an accelerator versus a product and kind of, you know, show what we did with that.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And then to kind of also get your thoughts on whether you think like these are other clients if not blackstone, where we can apply this to because blackstone is a good target for this.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: We just need to sort of, you know, figure out who do we speak to and how do we go about it.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And then the last piece was that Chris is on the blackstone project and he is the one who used the Kodi tool to refactor or to accelerate his technical discovery process.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And I think like Chris and gang, they prepared a case study which they also presented at the blackstone QBR.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So we thought it would be good to sort of just.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: We thought it would be good to kind of give you guys just some, you know, oversight into or overview of what we did and what were the results we saw just to kind of get your thoughts and also get some views on how is it that we could use the tool better or anything around that?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking at a very high level.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Does that sound good?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah, I think that sounds great.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I might suggest that we take that in reverse order because I think, you know, Kodi we're in right now and that will stimulate some ideas.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And then definitely, I'm interested in how you guys have used amp and how we can showcase that within blackstone and elsewhere.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And then I think we could use that to figure out where, you know, how we might show it to people that we're positioning, you know, amp to.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And then we can think about that for blackstone and think about that, you know, kind of elsewhere.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So I might say let's start with the Kodi case study and then we can look at the amp stuff that you guys have done with nuevo.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And then we can think about kind of where to go.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: That's actually perfect.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah, that's perfect because Becky isn't here.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, you know, instead of waiting for her, we can do that and Chris is here, Chris, do you want to probably, you know, a couple of minutes, spend a couple of minutes on the case study on the Kodi case study, and then we go from there.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Rainey and cam, does that work for you guys?\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: Yeah, works great.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: We don't have slides or anything, but I can give you a high level overview basically.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: So we went into the project and we were dealing with a lot of legacy code and a lot of legacy SQL stuff.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: And some of these instances were running 2008 server and 2008 SQL.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: You know, obviously, that operating system is considerably aged out.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: So there was a bit of a skill gap we had and we essentially were able to use Kodi and sourcegraph to work with the information we could get from the systems, our current functional knowledge of powershell and backport it all to bat files and SQL connection strings that could be simplified to operate on a 2008 standard.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: We also use it to write a bunch of tests based on that output and generate test cases that would show SQL compatibility as well as build migration plans.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: And in the end, we ended up taking all the reports that were generated to our SQL queries and piping them back out.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: And then using Kodi to turn them into markdown and build out in a fairly extensive documentation library in a very user friendly way.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: So the acceleration process on the project was pretty massive and wide felt by the team.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: We were able to accomplish something that probably should have taken four months and roughly six weeks.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And so with that, you guys were using, so blackstone gave you access to their Kodi licenses?\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: Yes, that is.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Correct.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Okay.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Just out of curiosity, did they say we use doing time and materials?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And they said this will make you go faster.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: How did that?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: How did that kind of work?\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: No, it just kind of came about as a natural evolution of our work with them.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: They, they linked us up with their internal like.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: So we found out this existed, we asked for access to it much in the same way that would grant access to get a copilot.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: We were provisioned it.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: And then we designed sort of the patterns we use to leverage it and accelerate.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: That's cool.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: That's great.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And what's have you guys?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: It sounds like you guys have done a QBR with blackstone where you talk about that.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Are they like, did this resonate with them?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Have they seen similar results on their own et cetera?\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: We haven't done that sort of business evaluation with them.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: At this point.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: We're executing a multi phase contract and we're in between phases right now.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: So, I think once we complete the actual contract in its totality, there'll definitely be room for that sort of review.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: We, you know, have put into the roadmap, a fairly detailed retro of the experience not to highlight any negatives but to actually just take it as a learning experience.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: And, you know, show where we were able to execute with various tools.\nSpeaker 6992886974368770379: This will obviously come up and areas for improvement where we may have felt the tool gap.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Got it.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Okay.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Interesting.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah, would love to see.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I mean if you have two slides or anything in preparation for that, we'd be just, very curious on that and happy to support however we can, but that's impressive.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I'm glad to hear that you guys have had such good success with Kodi.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So we don't have slides on that, Tom, but there was a… there was a word doc that we have that was put together and I think they were like one or two pages in there that are relevant if you want.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: We can, I can pull up the word doc that I have, but yes, we don't have a case.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: We haven't prepared the case study yet.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah, would love to see the word doc.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Yeah, I was going to actually say, I think, that word doc, that word doc would be helpful.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: So, Cameron and I have, we've got a, like a biweekly sync with them on Wednesday of this week.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: And one of the topics that we want to bring up is obviously, they're using Kodi and they're using it in a really successful way and they're looking, you know, in this direction of like agentic behavior.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: And we're up against, you know, little old sourcegraph over here.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: We're running up.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: We're competing against anthropic for, that side of the business.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: And it's a, this is a long tail cell that we're going to be doing, but I think that this could be helpful and we could, you know, we could create even a slide on our side.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: This would be helpful to just talk about, yeah, like not only taking that success but what could that look like, you know, with a more agentic behavior?\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: And so we can create this chronological order of, from nothing to something to nothing.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Something else.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I think it'd be super helpful.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And, and we just wanted to talk a bit about that on the anthropic piece, Jonathan, but we can just talk for a bit.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yep.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: This is the, these are like kind of, the, this is what we presented to them at the QBR.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, some of this, Chris talked about the timeline efficiency where instead of like three to six month baseline, we brought down the discovery phase to six weeks, 60 percent reduction in manual analysis efforts with only two engineers, 40 percent improvement in issue identification, stakeholder alignment, coverage and risk reduction.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yep.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And then, and then, yes, a bit of what were the technical best practices and methodologies employed?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, I wasn't part of the QBR or rather, I wasn't there when the QBR happened.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So I don't know about what, I don't know about specific feedback on this, but I think overall, it was all very well received.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: The entire QBR went well.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And I think what I heard was like, blackstone is kind of really interested in certain things that we talked about around AI and I think this was probably the key component of it.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And, they probably, I think they said that we should have a follow up discussion because as you can imagine that QBR had a lot of the procurement guys, vendor guys, who may not necessarily sort of drive these initiatives.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: But if it's helpful, we could probably, snip out these two pages and send over to you.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Yeah, I think it, yeah, I think it definitely would be helpful.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I mean, cause it, you know, will be obviously, I think helpful for both parties.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I think, you know, in our discussions with them, you know, us referencing these kprs, sorry, these KPIs with labfortynine, only continues to shine a great light on you all as well as the relationship that we have together?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And, this may be a Becky question, but do y'all know Ronan?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Do you know, who is the sort of lead, from blackstone and the QBR… who are the primary customers?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Is that, is that the CIO that you're selling into?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: It's a Becky question.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah, yeah, that's yeah, I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: No.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: No, no, it's all good.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: What was the other one?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Did she?\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Share?\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Sorry, I don't and I don't mean to go off cuff here, but, I believe my gosh.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I feel like when we had our last call, I, for some reason, I remember those names being mentioned.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah, I, Ronan had sent over some names, that I'd sent, I think on the blackstone channel, and I don't think we recognized any of them.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I didn't see any of them in, Salesforce.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I think, we also had talked about a few names when we met Becky, which would have been, that we were merge.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yep.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Yeah, I think that would just be, yeah, Tom, I was able to find that, but I think that'd be helpful to get any names from Becky cause we can do some name dropping on our side, cam and I can.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah, Becky.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I think she had accepted the invite.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: She confirmed in a chat this morning.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Let me just ping her.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I think overall, Tom, you had mentioned that, none of those names rang a bell.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah, and, I think even if they don't well, I mean, maybe we'll move on and look at the nuevo stuff, but I think even if they don't it's just useful for us to say, we understand this is being used, but if we can just, I think contextualize a little bit more, you know, beyond those names of, you know, contextualize where you guys, are working and I think we got some of that, but maybe tie that, into the names.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Just so it's a natural sort of, cross referencing.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I think that'll be, is rainy says here?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I think that will be useful for both of us.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I agree.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Just pinged Becky.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I'm sorry about this.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: She had, in a group internal chat this morning.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: She had said that she's attending.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Well, maybe should we look at the nuevo stuff while we're kind of waiting for that?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, I think Ross has a bit of a, his laptop is running some sort of an update, but give me a second.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Ross, I just pinged over the video to you.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I don't know if you can, it can even access it right now or not really.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Ross, you're on mute.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: If you're trying to speak.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Yeah, thank you.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: No, I can't, I'm on my phone at the moment.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: My laptop is doing a Microsoft update.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I can't do anything with any Microsoft products.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Fun times.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: We've all been there, buddy.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: We've all been there.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I pushed the update out to tomorrow.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: It prompted me this morning.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And the last time I did an update, I literally could not use my laptop and had to go into work to get it sorted out.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, and Chris, you?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Well, Chris isn't aware of what's been done.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, Ross, if I was to try and run the video, would you be able to kind of tell me where to go and talk through it?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Or is that tough given that you are not on your phone?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I can absolutely do it from my phone, no problem.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Give me a second.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Then let's see.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Let me just try and give me a second guys.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And meanwhile, Chris or Ross, if one of you can like ping Becky, I just pinged her, but if you can like ping her and ask if she's joining, that would be helpful.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Will do.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And I'm just pulling out the email I sent to you about, the stakeholders, maybe we can give me a second.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And so, Jonathan, what was your question on the stakeholders as to what area are we working with them in?\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Yeah, yeah, I think so, just kind of sharing what, my thoughts are here is, having those stakeholders.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: So, Cameron and I are meeting with, a few folks on the blackstone team next week that, subscribe to Cody, like they own the Cody relationship and they own the code search relationship.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: So that the part, the partnership between sourcegraph and them, and one of the topics that I think would be super helpful, you know, just even just not just name dropping but talking about, like, hey, one of our partners that we, you know, work with lab, they worked on this nuevo product with you guys or, you know, they did this huge code refactoring with Cody.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: So we're seeing success on different, you know, all around this relationship.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Like is there any way, you know, you guys would want to speak with these people, get a referral?\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Like just trying to find more synergy, because again, like we're going to, you know, we're running up against the anthropic which is obviously a goliath in this space.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: And so, you know, the more data points that we have, can help us emphasize like the value proposition and the partnership.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Got it.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: That's helpful.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And do you, or do you know which side are they leaning?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Because I think, Tom had mentioned that amp, is not Aws native.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: It's on GCP and it seems like blackstone is all in on Aws.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And I think anthropic is Aws native or Aws?\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, so, do you have a sense like, if that's going to be a deciding factor?\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: You know, I don't like, I think that in Cameron, if you want to touch on this because you were on that last conversation, but I mean, my, I'll give you my perspective is, in this space, it's not one tool to rule them all like you've got a tool shed, you got to have a hammer and you got to have a screwdriver.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: And I think that, you know, there's always an opportunity whether there's competition in there or there isn't, you know, inevitably, they're probably going to use anthropic, then they're probably, you know, we're going to do a good job and we're going to get in there as well.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: So that's just my take.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: I believe that too, and I think our primary contact and like I would say, champion, like, also believes that, he's very much playing like, the politics of it right now, right?\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: Like blackrock gives 400,000,000 to anthropic.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: The business is going to use cloud code.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: With that being said, I think we got like a different tale of events, at least like a different, maybe, like more like leadership high level narrative from, you know, his boss, that's close with our CEO and, our head of revenue.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: And then they're also not going to start rolling out cloud code to users until Q1.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: But, you know, he's said like we anticipate using multiple tools next year.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: The thing is so, like, maybe we're in the same situation.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: It just went from like, you know, we were hoping to get some eyes on this sooner rather than later.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: And maybe this is, you know, Q1, Q2 for us next year, but, I think Rainey hit it, on the head, right?\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: They're going to need multiple tools and I think their developers are already saying that, but right now, they're going to get a developer toolkit that includes, the take home bundle.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Got it.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, on this, yeah.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I'm sorry, just, I have one small point on that, topic.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: There's ample that amp provides that cloud code can't like just to put that out there, there's plenty of things that we can say about what amp can do and its capabilities and how user friendly it is that can't be said about your competitors just to put that out there?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Like I've played with both sets of tools and I can honestly say that there's one I prefer over the others and that would be that'd be it.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Yeah, really appreciate you saying that.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: And like that is a lot oftentimes the sentiment, that we will hear from users.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: And, yeah, I, I don't know how we can, get a quote from you on that or, you know, what we'll name drop you, but, yeah, I think that we're hearing similar sentiment.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I think it's in the use of, or maybe it's you know, nuevo demo is the way to do that.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: If we can show that or reference that, and then use that as a jumping off point.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So, here's, why, you know, amp was uniquely suited for this task.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah, we can do that.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, do we want to, you know, shift gears and discuss the piece that we had around?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I think you guys had some questions, Jonathan, I forget if it was you or Cameron who mentioned about stakeholders and do we want to discuss that with Becky?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Hopefully hopefully by the time that wraps up, Russ's laptop is functional again and we can look at nuevo versus me having to drive with video.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Yeah, real quick.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I just one follow up question or point that I wanted to direct at Russ.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: An idea that I do have is, you know, again, like how do we create synergy for both orgs?\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Like, how do we grow your guys' footprint?\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: How do we grow our footprint?\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I do like this idea of like focusing on the nuevo product.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I think what could be helpful is like we don't have like when on our call, with them on Wednesday, it's going to be very light.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: They're a great group, of individuals who we have a great relationship with.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: So, it's very loose.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I'm kind of thinking about it and going into it and mentioning, and maybe even possibly having screenshot of the product if you guys feel comfortable.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Obviously, you guys can block out whatever you guys need to.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: But having that as a backdrop to say, like our relationship here, clearly, you know, like there's value that they're bringing to you all we have this quote from and Russ, this is where I put you on a spot here.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I have a quote from Russ who's building within these products that you guys are loving that his preference is, you know, amp and is, you know, and just building this center synergy where all things are leading towards growth on this product.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I know it's a diatribe.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: So it maybe didn't make sense, but that's just kind of where my head's at.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So what we could do, Jonathan, like we have a case study on the nuevo product and I think like it also has, it also has some, what's the word?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I'm looking for UI, UI, wireframes and things like that.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And Russ correct me if I'm wrong.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Essentially, what you did is like you sort of used the nuevo code, and basically used amp to sort of refactor the code and be like, hey, what does this part of the code do?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: What does that part of the code do?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: That was sort of in a sense what you did with amp, is that correct?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So, given, timeframes and constraints here.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I'll try to keep this as quick as possible.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: What I showed off in the demo was everything from lighting up a new project from scratch, basically what you guys showed us, but kind of from a different lens to taking an existing live code base that had hackathon grade code and refactoring said hackathon grade code into something, much closer to production ready.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I cut out all the processing time and everything like behind the scenes, but you see the prompts that go into it, you see the results, you see how it thinks you see using it from the perspective of, straight cli, to what it looks like in like VS code, plugin, et cetera, and how to iterate on those things.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I threw in some impromptu stuff like, oh, hey, the user came back and asked me for this random thing that wasn't in spec.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Like, how do we handle that?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: How can we do that?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: How do we, as a developer work with some of these AI tools?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: How do we interact with it?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Because AI can't do all the work?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: It can do a lot of it just can't do all of it.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So, how do we interact with that?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: How do we parse this et cetera?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So, those are the types of things that I go through in the video and kind of show how it looks with an actual code base.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Does that answer the question that was super.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Helpful.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: No, that was super helpful for us.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah, we want to see it though.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So, how… do.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: you want to do it?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Ross, do you want, is your laptop still out of commission?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Well, the mac OS has decided to reboot so, it's going to be at least a couple of minutes, but if you want to show it, you can just fast forward to it to the nuevo part and just play it?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I'll try this, I.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Think, that starts at… 20.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Well, so, is the whole video about amp, or is the video a broader topic?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: The whole thing's about amp.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Oh, wow.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Okay.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Well, Ronnie.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: If you want, you can just send it over man.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: If they want to watch it, it's a long video.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: The whole thing is long.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: It's it's there's there, was it?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Didn't work?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: There was, yeah, there, there's nothing brief about the video.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: It's pretty in depth.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: But, you know what, how about this?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Let's, let's let, I'm able to load it.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Let's get it to minute 20 because I think that is where.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, so Tom, the entire video is about amp, but I think minute 20 to minute, something is about nuevo.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So that's probably of most interest.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And, and if I try to play the audio through it, it's going to get messed up.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, maybe we can just have the video and Ross, you want to talk through it, does that work?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Absolutely.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I can absolutely do that.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: All right.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Let me just fill this out.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Guys.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: This is like, look at us.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: A bunch of folks can't get a video working but want to sell.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: If you, yeah, fly on the wall, we don't none of us work in tech.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: And the next portion?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And this was like, pretty much this was always the case when I was in blockchain and all of us are like on blockchain and rewiring financial infrastructure.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And it's like, hey, wait, I can't share my screen because zoom's not letting me do.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: You.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: guys want to change the way DTCC settles trades, but you can't get zoom to work.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Sounds about right?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yup.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: All right.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Can you see my screen?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Yup.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, Ross, I'll take your lead, buddy.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: You can, there's no voice over here.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: You go for it.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I'll change that.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So, the first section here, I have the, read me open and I'm trying to figure out what's going on with this repo.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: It's a large repo.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: There's a lot going on.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I'm talking about how to get it installed a little bit, just go to the website.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: It's a couple of button clicks, et cetera.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: And sorry for my fat fingers in the video, but, massive, read me large code base, pretending like I don't really know what's going on.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I just want a quick deep dive, a summary of a deep dive into what the heck is going on.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So, I toss a prompt in here.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: None of this in the video is pre engineered, not this portion, the first half of the video, I scripted all of it, the second half, not so much.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So you see here now, we've got a little summary of what's going on.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: It kind of goes through, I double check it.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Everything looks pretty good.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I talk a lot as I am ought to do, let's see where do we go?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I think we go to a refactor, oh, no, we go to another explanation.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Okay.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: That's what I'm doing.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So, we're going to go and take a look at one of the larger, chunks of code the agents file in this, and we're going to ask it to explain what the heck is going on.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: And I do know a couple of times throughout this.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: And the reason why this is a little bit more free form than others than the first half rather is simply because if you ask it to do the same thing, twice even in different contexts because of how llms work.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Obviously, it's going to process things slightly different.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So, I don't have anything super prescriptive or overly scripted in these.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So here, in a second, we're going to take a look at, what it looks like when you ask it to explain… in a minute.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I guess I talk a lot faster on zoom than I did when I was recording.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: You can fast forward a little bit, Ronnie.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: There we go.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Oh, yeah, this is perfect.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Okay.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So, this is something that you guys do that, your competitors don't is your tools will generate diagrams, which is, really nice.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: And the other thing that I would point out that you guys do that your competitors don't is your plugins are, very clean, with your competition, you have to use their terminal within your IDE, the pro to that is, it makes it a little bit more, functional for cross… IDE, work, but the downside.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Is it's, very clunky when you're trying to use it like, your competitors products, they're very clunky because it always has to be terminal based.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: All right.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Here, I think we're doing a refactor.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So we're going to have it do a refactor now and kind of show off what that looks like to show.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Okay, we can go from getting information, some explanation straight into this file's.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Huge.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: There's too many things going on.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: You can clearly see that from the diagram your code produced, let's get it refactored.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So, it goes through and it chews on that for a second… scroll back through.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Talk about what it did show off the fact that you're showing diffs, I think in this segment, I actually talk about, your approval mechanism where, you ask permission to make changes and stuff like that.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I'd given, the tool blanket permission to make whatever changes it wanted.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So, I didn't end up actually being able to show that.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I don't think, cause when I was kind of playing around with this, it would have, it… would have popped up.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Okay.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Here, I'm actually showing off the fact that it corrects.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So, it went through, it made code changes and then it made a mistake.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: And it went back, it looked, it found its mistake, it corrected the mistake, iterated on things.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: There's I might not have included the clip in this demo, but I actually showed off what happens if you tell it to do explicit testing, before and after each iteration, of change and it'll go through and do the testing and it kind of shows that off, that might not be in this segment, but I definitely have one somewhere on my laptop with that info.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Yeah, Russ, I think that's actually, like talking about, I literally had this conversation with a customer yesterday, about or a user who has his entire team using amp, they put definitive guidelines in the agents MD file that, essentially tell the agent and the sub agents downline when basically like when to create the output and what to focus on.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Because you mentioned something earlier that like, as you grow and grow like your context window gets so large that it's all being used as context and sometimes you don't want that.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: And so like, dude, I love everything you're showing us here like that's the exact way the approach, like I'm jacked up on this.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: This is awesome.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: In the, in the video itself, in, the language that I use, I do talk about context and I do mention, where you show the percentage context used and I try my best, maybe not as well as you folks could.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: But I try my best to explain context, how it works and when you're doing a task, be as detailed as you can, but keep each thread to one task.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: For this demo.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: What I was doing was so small that I could leave it all in one context because I'm not doing too much here by comparison to what the tool can do.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I'm keeping it pretty limited, but I do talk about context making sure you're paying attention to it.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: And that's another thing that your competitors don't offer like, what is it called?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: They don't talk to you about context.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: They don't tell you what you're utilizing.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: They don't tell you how it works.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: There's no information on it.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: There's nothing in their documentation on it.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: You just need to have a reasonable understanding of how llms work and how agentic workflows function cause llms in and of themselves are stateless, right?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Like by themselves, they're stateless.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: It's all about the agentic workflow and you have agents backing this.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: They retain state that's your context, right?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: So, people need to understand to wipe it.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: But you're the only folks that are talking about it and giving information to your users.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Like I don't need to fully understand how your tool works to understand, okay, I'm 80 percent or it's giving me really weird answers.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: It's talking about stuff I said yesterday and I don't need that right now.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Let's change it.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: You're yeah, that's one thing that I do mention in the video that I haven't talked about yet, but I do talk about that, in the demo for sure.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Hey, Russ, what's the, who's the, when you made this video?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Who's the audience?\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: It was mostly internal to be Frank.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: It was to kind of show off the capabilities of what this toolkit can do for… everybody else here at lab.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: It was, meant to be a stepping stone to something that we could present to clients, hopefully presenting you folks as well.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: But, it was, this video, the first pass was a stepping stone to get some of our other devs to start pitching this to clients, maybe to even use it directly, but, ideally to pitch to clients and be like, hey, like this tool can accelerate everything you're doing.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: You should seriously consider it.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: And here is why.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah, yes, come to give you like a bit of background.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: We had an engineering town hall.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I think it was about a month or so ago, and that's where Chris presented Cody or talked about Cody and how it helped them in the blackstone project.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And, and before that is when Chris had sort of told us that, hey, here's this really cool tool.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: We should look into a partnership that's how you and I got talking.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And Russ, Russ volunteer to sort of dig deep into amp.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And, and yes, the idea is that, you know, he's of course, now comfortable with amp, he thinks that adds a lot of value and that's obviously important to have like that one technical champion if you will.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And the audience right now is internal, but, but yeah, they were two objectives.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: One is to, of course, present it back to you and, you know, show that, hey, we understand, amp, we kind of sort of know what we are talking about when we play around with tools and sort of gain your confidence.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Now, show this, and this is a piece that we have to work on a bit, like also show it internally to other technical architects or technical sales folks, if you will, for lack of a better word and encourage them to start thinking as to how they could use a tool like amp in their, in their client engagements and sort of, you know, Cody, amp, et cetera, use this to hasten up your discovery process, add efficiencies to the process, add efficiencies for the client?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Are you guys comfortable sharing the video with us?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I think we could, if he can find out a way to do it because it's a couple of GB.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Okay.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: You can just upload it to any of the drives, a Google drive, I think that works.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: If,\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: you, if you just Ronnie, if you're cool with us sharing it, if somebody just sends me a link, I can drop it.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: mean, there's nothing proprietary in there, right?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Ross is just really new Evo, which, yeah.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay, perfect.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I mean, yeah, new Evo, is public information, so there's nothing proprietary.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Exactly.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, so I think what we could do, and I know we only have a few minutes left.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, so what we were hoping for through this, Tom, Jonathan Cameron, is that, of course, you know, hopefully, you guys know, it gives you confidence that Ross knows what he's talking about and we have a fairly good grasp of the product, or he does.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I shouldn't say we, it's all him at this point.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, come on.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Ronnie, greater we.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: well, let's say he, because if this doesn't work, then we have one throat to choke.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: We win as a team, we lose as an individual.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So yeah.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So we really wanted to, one, of course, show that to you.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And second is, and this is where I think now that Becky's on the call, this could be useful.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, so nuevo to take a step back, it is basically AI for investment research.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So today, like if I'm an investment, if, if I'm a research analyst, you know, anytime I need to research a stock, I obviously need to do a bunch of things.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I need to go through the financials.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I need to go through all the news and of course, in today's day and age, there's also, you know, like what if, what if portis would tweet that, hey, now, I'm going to issue a 200 percent tariff, on all, iphones that are imported from China.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, all of a sudden, what's that going to do to apple?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, so as an investment analyst, you have to do a lot of work today.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And the idea of the nuevo tool is to take away the busy work from you.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: It's not to replace the research analyst, but it's like, you know, based on, internal notes, based on financial data, based on what's going on Twitter or something of that sort, we can give you a buy sell recommendation.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: We can help you draft a research note, but it's meant as an accelerator.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And the idea is that if the research analyst, the busy work goes away, then they can research more tickers, they can be more efficient, you know, every, everything that is sort of the cornerstone of a good AI product.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And then going at that is that if you think about it, this is really applicable to any research firm.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: We've configured the workflow to appeal more to the buy side.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So someone like blackstone, this is applicable to them.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So there are two ways that we can think about this one is that, of course, Jonathan and Cameron, you guys have the relationship with blackstone and, you know, and with, we can probably use a few minutes to chat with Becky yesterday, who we talked to, who you talked to and see how we can progress this within the account.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: But more importantly, as you're talking to other research firms as you are talking to other.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah… other customers in this space to begin with, we would love this for you.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: We would love for this to be a part of your sales kit.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, you know, you kind of talking hypotheticals, how it could help, it could be like, hey, here's a product that was built out by our partner and this is how they are using amp.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, you know, use that as a way.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: To sort of, yeah, in advanced customers.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Right.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I think that's right?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So, I think the talk track, so one, we'll take a look at the video and I think we'll probably have some comments but also just, it's going to get us excited.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I mean, we like what we've seen on it so far.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I think the second is using this with blackstone and just making sure that we, that we appropriately introduce it.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And so I, we've got the voiceover, and we can talk.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I think it will be good to just say, you know, we're talking to lab, we were developing them as a partner.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: We've had a great relationship.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: They've been investing in amp, you know, here's, kind of the use case, you should go talk to, go talk to Russ, go talk to Ronnie and Russ, and Becky.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: They're already engaged within your account.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I think that's good for us.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And then, yes, I think, you know, based upon, the, you know, based upon that traction.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And the video, you know, you've actually got a couple of different functions represented on this call.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And we can, you know, I think we will use this and I'm glad that this is an asset, but I want to, I want to see it.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: But I think it, is, this is an asset or something related to it will be an asset that we can use in other, you know, large financial services, organizations.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So, yes, and absolutely, if that can get you guys in there, that's what we want to do.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And I think you understand, yeah, the third party validation on the app, is very powerful for us.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So, this, I think sets up quite well.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And just on that, Tom, before we really want to give Becky and Jonathan a chance to talk to each other on that, Tom, of course, like, the reason why we did nuevo is because it was, it was already there.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: But if let's just say you say that, hey, you know, what hedge funds are a massive target for us?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And we feel that if you were to pick up this investment management process, do something quick and dirty, we think that could help us land like we would love to get that insight from you as well, and see what we can do.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Of course, as of now, Russ is on bench though, you know, that could change anytime, but at our end, what we are trying to do is like, you're not just create demos for the heck of it, this was created for Aws but, you know, like to your point, if you were to come and give us some insights that if you would be able to do this, we think we can position you well, we would be more than happy to create something that is sort of an ongoing asset for you.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I mean, I'm sure, you know, existing code is, and that's why I like it that's an existing project, that you're working on because building something new is actually pretty easy and working with something existing, is much harder, but it's the real world.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: True.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: All right.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, yeah.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, okay, Jonathan, I know you're like.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Yeah, I apologize.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I got a job.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Becky, I've got some contacts, that I'm going to share, we can just put them in the slack channel.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Okay?\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: And then if you can just like confirm these are folks and then add to it.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: That works.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: All right, guys.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: Sorry about that.\nSpeaker 6708049299094076983: I have to drop.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And Cameron, everything from your side, you handle blackstone as well?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Did I get that right?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: I'm the account manager for blackstone.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: Yeah,\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And that's Becky on our side.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, I know we had sent some names over, but do you want to like quickly?\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I don't know if you guys always take a few minutes to talk about who you talked to at blackstone, what teams same at all?\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: We need to drop here in a minute.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: To, I'll say, I didn't recognize any of the names on the list.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: I primarily work with, Amir and, there's another gentleman from Brazil that I work with, but we have a pretty small team, cause, on the search and Cody side of things.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: And, we did go on site with them with a larger audience to talk about amp, before it was, it before it was amp, like going back to, I think it actually might've been in January.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: So, I think at that point, it was just an idea, but we kind of showed like the future of like what we were thinking agentically.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: But no, I didn't know any of the names on the list that you had sent over.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah, which departments are you talking to, if I could ask?\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: Get you to the actual title work?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And Cameron is our executive sponsor on the, has he been on the cat on the, yeah, on the cab?\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: Monty?\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: So, we primarily work with their dev ops org, and, Monty hall is, on our customer advisory board and his title, he's I mean, he's okay.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: So, he's their CTO.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: Yeah, I've never actually met with him.\nSpeaker 8808625323536124591: I've heard him on one call, but, he has a relationship with our CEO.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Okay.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah, that's a familiar name.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, yeah, so, I guess, Cameron, you need to drop.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, Tom, I guess as, next steps, will you, we can send you that case study and that can happen over email and this video.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: We could find a way we can find a way to get it across to you.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: I'm not sure if you're on slack, Russ, but I'm not, but I can join and try to get across to Eric.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: But besides these two, pieces, yeah.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I'm on slack.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I'll send it over as soon as my computer is done throwing a temper tantrum.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay, cool.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And what do you suggest would be some next steps Tom?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So, I think very specific.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So, this group will all go watch that video, and I think that's going to give us ideas of where we can use it and also feedback on the video.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And so, I think that's also going to give us context on how to introduce it.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So, I think that's one thing is we'll just review the video and then provide some feedback on it.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Then I think the second thing is it sounds like rainy, and, Cameron, blackstone meeting next week.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And so, I think that it will make sense to introduce this concept into our group, our buyers, and we can give you more details, on those folks, via slack, but just, introduce that we're working with you guys and that you guys are having good success with amp, it'll give you some visibility, hopefully give us more credibility, on amp, and so, we'll do that, you know, we'll plan to do that, in next week's, meeting with them.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And then the third thing is, you know, pending that success, and understanding the video, we'll mention this next week, I'll figure out what the, right, like what the right meeting is.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: But to some of our field based resources, I think they would do a meeting or we'll just do it tactically, in terms of getting a couple of other, reps, but let me think about how to do it.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: But what I want to do is, to figure out who our next accounts are, to be able to introduce this like introduce this in that's all sort of pending on, you know, we'll have to figure out we'll figure out the blackstone, exactly what the story is and, how we introduce it.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I think it's pretty straightforward but I just want to like, we just need to think through what that is.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Is it a side mention or is it a pretty slide or is it, you know, hey, go watch this video that's on YouTube, who knows, we'll have to like, we'll figure that out, but that's just kind of the flow that I, the flow that, I foresee but I think, our team will be hungry to use this in the, you know, in the financial services domain.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So, I think we're pretty excited about this.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Awesome.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And, and probably a question on this, Tom, well, kind of related, but not so much, you mentioned that amp is GCP native.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: What does that mean for Aws customers like blackstone?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Well… it depends a little bit.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: It's a little different for every customer.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: But generally, what it means is that since it's given that it's hosted, yeah, given that it's a hosted product, whether it's hosted on Aws or it's hosted on GCP, the customer or the prospect is going to want to understand our security controls because it's running within our workspace versus running in their workspace.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So, Cody, for example, is running in the customer's Aws environment.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And so, what it means generally is that their security teams are going to do a pretty thorough review, of what we're doing, and we've got, I don't know, soc two and all sorts of different certifications.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: We've got a security team.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: We've got a security portal.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So, generally what it means is they're reviewing all that stuff, and then, you know, then approving it, but it's not, materially different from a review that they would do if it was being hosted on, hosted on Aws.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay, cool.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: All right.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Yes.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: There are people that say, oh, we want to run this, you know, we want to run this within our own environment, but then there become, very few, solutions which are available.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Okay, cool.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: All right.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, so, I think Tom, like you and I can stay in touch over email.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: We'll of course, send over the information and then, let's see what we can, where we can go with this.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: But, yes, in general, I think, you know, for us, it's been like, really valuable to see amp in action, and, you know, thanks to Russ that he spent all this time understanding the product and like applying it really well.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, hopefully, that gives you some confidence, in our ability.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Oh, it does absolutely, because, yes, it's easy for people to just look at it and say, yeah, I get it.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: But till you've dug in, and actually done something real.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So it certainly appears, that Russ has been wrestling with, you know, a big code base, and using the tool effectively.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: So, yeah, that, that's fantastic to see.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Awesome.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Cool.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: So, we'll wait to hear back from you.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: And, of course, yeah, hopefully we can, both expand in blackstone and other places.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: It'd be awesome.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Russ.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: If you have any trouble uploading that, let us know and we'll figure out what plan B is or plan C or plan?\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah, we'll get it over, one way or another, hopefully not, with, without a usb drive.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Carry, carry your pigeon, carry your pigeon.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: There we go.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: And, may your laptop heal itself.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Thanks.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Appreciate it.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: That's a general piece of advice anytime you're doing a laptop update, only do it if you are either at the office or within reasonable commuting distance because this thing, it breaks more often than it works.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Dude, I didn't even want to do it.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: It didn't give me a choice.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: I kept snoozing,\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: it because I wanted to keep working.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I was like, I was neck deep in a project and it was just like, nah, no more choices.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: The joy of working for a firm that sells to financial institutions.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Yeah, it.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Happens, Russ, for a lot of people.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: If you're a sales Guy, if that happened on Friday, it would be a sign that it was time to go play golf.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Well, not if it's the last Friday of the month and you've got monthly accelerator bonuses or quarterly bonuses.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: There we go.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah, very true.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Very true none.\nSpeaker 3448598355429170500: Of us work for oracle, so that's not the case right now.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: All right.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Yeah, Becky, Ronnie, Russ.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Thank y'all this is exciting.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: Thanks.\nSpeaker 4214719112111247390: I appreciate it.\nSpeaker 8058835196957214049: Bye.",

That's a bold strategic move - and exactly the shift we're seeing at other high-growth companies.\n\nAmp is the enterprise AI coding assistant built for engineers who use AI *intelligently* - not just autocomplete. With 1M token context windows, GPT-5 powered architectural review (Oracle), and integration with your internal tools via MCP, Amp handles the complex work you described at re:Invent: microservices debugging, large-scale refactoring, and acquisition integration.\n\nGiven your recent MagicBrief acquisition and developer platform expansion, I'd love to show you how Amp can make your 626 engineers 3-5x faster on complex tasks.\n\nWorth 20 minutes?\"\n\n### Alternative Entry Points\n\n1. **Via Developer Platform Team**: \"You're building APIs for 300 apps. Want to ship faster with auto-generated tests and docs?\"\n2. **Via Engineering Directors**: \"Managing microservices complexity? Amp's large context helps engineers understand cross-service dependencies.\"\n3. **Via Recruiting/Talent**: \"You're hiring for AI tool competency. Shouldn't you equip your current team with enterprise AI coding tools?\"\n\n### Discovery Questions\n\n1. \"You changed interview assessments to test AI tool usage - what tools are your engineers currently using?\"\n2. \"How is the MagicBrief integration going? What's been most challenging about merging the codebases?\"\n3. \"Your developer platform hit 1B uses - what's the biggest bottleneck in shipping new APIs?\"\n4. \"You discussed microservices complexity at re:Invent - how do engineers currently debug cross-service issues?\"\n5. \"With 626 engineers across 5 locations, how do you maintain code consistency?\"\n\n---\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n### Objection: \"We already have GitHub Copilot\"\n\n**Response**: \n\"Copilot is excellent for line-level completions - keep using it. Amp complements Copilot for architecture-level work:\n- Understanding dependencies across your microservices (1M token context)\n- Reviewing complex refactoring plans before execution (Oracle with GPT-5)\n- Integrating acquired codebases like MagicBrief (Finder + large context)\n- Making consistent changes across multiple services (subagents)\n\nThink of Copilot as autocomplete, Amp as your senior engineer pair programmer. Your CTO wants engineers who use AI tools *intelligently* - that means knowing when you need deep reasoning and large context, not just autocomplete.\"\n\n### Objection: \"Our engineers are already very productive\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"Absolutely - 240M users and $2.7B revenue prove it. But your CTO is explicitly hiring for engineers who can use AI tools to be 3-5x more productive. That's the strategic bet: already-great engineers become exceptional with the right AI tools. Amp is the enterprise tool that delivers on that vision with security, scale, and SOC 2 compliance.\"\n\n### Objection: \"We build our own internal tools\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"That's impressive - your experimentation platform is a great example. Amp actually accelerates building *more* internal tools. Plus, Amp integrates with your internal tools via MCP, so your engineers can access Canva-specific workflows right in their coding assistant. The teams who built your experimentation platform could build the next one 3x faster with Amp.\"\n\n### Objection: \"We need to see ROI\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"Fair. Typical Amp customers see:\n- 3-5x faster on complex tasks (refactoring, debugging, integration)\n- 50% faster onboarding for new engineers\n- Fewer production bugs from better testing and code review\n\nWith 626 engineers, even a 20% productivity gain is 125 full-time engineers worth of output. At your engineer cost (~$200K loaded), that's $25M annual value. Amp pays for itself in the first month.\n\nWant to pilot with your developer platform team or AI features team first?\"\n"

With Copilot, you'd get code suggestions but still manually wire up tests, docs, validation. Amp understands your entire development workflow.\"\n\n## Pilot Options\n\n### **Pilot Option 1: Developer Platform Team (2-4 weeks)**\n\n**Target Team**: API development team building Content Query, Design Editing, Tables APIs\n\n**Objectives**:\n- Accelerate API endpoint development by 30%+\n- Reduce time from API design to tested implementation\n- Improve API documentation consistency\n\n**Success Metrics**:\n- API endpoints shipped per sprint\n- Time to implement new endpoint (design → tested code)\n- Developer satisfaction scores\n- Code review cycle time reduction\n\n**Rollout**:\n1. **Week 1**: Onboard 3-5 senior engineers with AGENTS.md setup\n2. **Week 2**: Expand to 10 engineers, measure baseline metrics\n3. **Week 3-4**: Full team usage, collect feedback, iterate on AGENTS.md conventions\n\n**Why This Team**:\n- High-impact work: developer platform affects 300+ external apps\n- Clear metrics: API development has measurable velocity\n- Pattern-heavy work: APIs follow conventions - perfect for AI code generation\n- Brendan Humphreys (CTO) closely involved with platform strategy\n\n**Integration Points**:\n- Connect Amp to Canva's MCP server for internal tool access\n- Configure AGENTS.md with API development standards\n- Set up JetBrains/VS Code integrations for team's preferred IDEs\n\n### **Pilot Option 2: Experimentation Platform Team (2-4 weeks)**\n\n**Target Team**: Team maintaining in-house experimentation platform\n\n**Objectives**:\n- Accelerate platform feature development\n- Improve code quality for self-service features\n- Reduce technical debt accumulation\n\n**Success Metrics**:\n- Feature delivery velocity (self-service capabilities shipped)\n- Reduction in data scientist support requests\n- Code review approval time\n- Test coverage improvements\n\n**Rollout**:\n1. **Week 1**: Onboard 2-3 platform engineers\n2. **Week 2**: Use Amp for one complete feature (e.g., new experiment type)\n3. **Week 3-4**: Expand to broader team, tackle technical debt backlog\n\n**Why This Team**:\n- Strategic priority: democratizing experimentation is a stated goal ([Canva Engineering Blog](https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/how-we-build-experiments-in-house/), 2024-06-27)\n- Complex internal tooling: perfect use case for Oracle's architectural guidance\n- Python/Django stack: Amp excels with Python\n- Clear \"before/after\": currently bottlenecked by data scientists\n\n**Integration Points**:\n- Configure Python/Django specific AGENTS.md rules\n- Set up Oracle for architectural reviews of new platform features\n- Use subagents for parallel work on frontend/backend/data layer\n\n## Recommended Approach\n\n**Start with Pilot Option 1 (Developer Platform Team)** because:\n\n1. **CTO visibility**: Platform work is strategic, Brendan Humphreys will see impact directly\n2. **External multiplier**: Improvements affect 300 apps, 122 countries of developers\n3. **Measurable impact**: API velocity is quantifiable\n4. **Proof point for rollout**: Success here justifies expanding to all 626 engineers\n\n**Expansion path after pilot**:\n1. Developer Platform Team (pilot) → 3-5 engineers\n2. Experimentation Platform Team → 5-10 engineers  \n3. AI Integration Teams (Leonardo.Ai, MagicBrief) → 20-30 engineers\n4. Microservices Infrastructure Teams → 50-100 engineers\n5. Full Engineering Organization → 626 engineers\n\n## Key Objections and Responses\n\n### \"We already use GitHub Copilot across the team\"\n\n**Response**: \"Copilot is great for line-level completions. But you're working at a different scale now - 1.2M requests/day across microservices, integrating AI acquisitions, managing a developer platform with 1B uses. You need a tool that understands your entire architecture, not just the next line. That's what Amp's 1M token context and Oracle provide. Think of Amp as your senior engineer pair programming, while Copilot is autocomplete.\"\n\n### \"How is this different from Cursor?\"\n\n**Response**: \"Three critical differences for Canva:\n1. **Scale**: Amp's context windows are 5-10x larger - essential for your microservices complexity\n2. **Reasoning**: Oracle gives you GPT-5 architectural guidance, not just code generation\n3. **Extensibility**: MCP integration means Amp works with your internal tools - you already publish an MCP server, so this is a natural fit\n\nCursor is excellent for smaller codebases. At 626 engineers and your architectural complexity, you need Amp's capabilities.\"\n\n### \"AI tools hallucinate and produce buggy code\"\n\n**Response**: \"Valid concern. That's why Amp has:\n1. **AGENTS.md**: Your conventions become enforceable rules, not suggestions\n2. **Oracle review mode**: GPT-5 reviews code before it goes out\n3. **Lint/test integration**: Amp runs your existing quality checks automatically\n4. **Tool permissions**: You control exactly what Amp can do\n\nYou told Fortune you want engineers who use AI 'intelligently' - Amp's design embodies that intelligence through guardrails and oversight.\"\n\n### \"This will replace our engineers\"\n\n**Response**: \"Brendan said it perfectly in his Fortune interview - you're looking for engineers who work intelligently WITH AI tools. Amp makes your 626 engineers more effective, not redundant. They spend time on architecture, product decisions, complex debugging - the high-value work. Amp handles the mechanical coding. You're shipping more features with the same team, not fewer features with fewer people.\"\n\n## Pricing Context\n\n**Canva's Scale**: 626 engineers\n\n**Amp Enterprise Pricing** ([Amp Manual](https://ampcode.com/manual#pricing)):\n- SSO integration\n- Zero data retention option (critical for Canva's IP)\n- Managed org-wide settings\n- Pooled billing\n- Team workspaces\n\n**Estimated Investment**: ~$50-60/engineer/month for 626 seats = ~$375K-450K annually\n\n**ROI Calculation**:\n- **30% productivity gain** (conservative) × 626 engineers = 188 engineer-equivalents\n- At $150K loaded cost/engineer = **$28M annual value**\n- **ROI: 62-75x**\n\n**Comparable Investments**: Canva spent $22.5M on MagicBrief acquisition ([Forbes Australia](https://www.forbes.com.au/news/innovation/canva-to-acquire-australian-ai-platform-magicbrief/), 2025-06-18). Amp delivers similar strategic value for 2% of that cost.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Technical deep-dive**: Brendan Humphreys + VP Engineering (30 min)\n2. **Pilot planning**: Identify Developer Platform team lead, scope first sprint\n3. **AGENTS.md workshop**: Work with team to encode Canva's conventions (1 hour)\n4. **Pilot kickoff**: Onboard 3-5 engineers, begin metrics collection\n5. **Week 2 check-in**: Review metrics, adjust approach\n6. **Week 4 results review**: Present data to leadership, plan rollout\n\n---\n\n**Key Insight**: Canva is explicitly preparing for an AI-augmented engineering culture (Fortune interview).

Cursor? Other?)\n- Identify 1-2 specific pain points we can address\n- Schedule technical deep-dive or pilot planning session\n\n## Opening (5 minutes)\n\n### Introduction\n\n**Talk Track**:\n\n\"Brendan, thanks for taking the time. I'm [Name] from Amp, an AI coding assistant built by Sourcegraph. I saw your Fortune interview where you mentioned changing engineering assessments to evaluate how candidates work with AI tools - that really resonated because it's exactly the problem we solve: helping engineers work *intelligently* with AI, not just use autocomplete.\n\nI also caught your AWS re:Invent talk about managing complexity at scale. With 626 engineers handling 1.2 million requests a day across microservices, you're dealing with a level of architectural complexity that most AI coding tools weren't designed for. That's why I wanted to connect.\n\nBefore I share what we do, I'd love to understand your current setup better.\"\n\n### Positioning Statement\n\n**If asked \"What does Amp do?\"**:\n\n\"Amp is an AI coding assistant, but designed for engineering teams at scale. While tools like Copilot focus on code completion, we're built for the complexity you're dealing with - massive codebases, microservices architectures, distributed teams. We can hold up to a million tokens of context in working memory, so we actually understand your full system architecture, not just the file you're editing.\n\nThink of it as having a senior engineer who's read your entire codebase pair programming with you, rather than an autocomplete tool.\n\nBut let me pause there - what are you using today for AI coding assistance?\"\n\n## Discovery Questions (20-25 minutes)\n\n### Section 1: Current State Assessment\n\n#### **Q1: AI Tool Adoption**\n\n**Question**: \"What AI coding tools are your engineers currently using? Are you standardized on anything, or is it more of a 'bring your own tool' situation?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- GitHub Copilot (most likely)\n- Cursor, Windsurf, other tools\n- Adoption rate (all engineers? subset?)\n- Satisfaction level (\"it's fine\" vs \"they love it\")\n\n**Follow-up based on response**:\n\n*If using Copilot*: \"Got it. What's working well with Copilot? And where do you find engineers still hitting friction?\"\n\n*If no standard tool*: \"Interesting - what's driving the 'bring your own tool' approach? Is it that nothing has met the bar, or is it more about letting engineers choose their workflow?\"\n\n*If using Cursor*: \"Cursor's great for smaller projects. How's it handling your microservices complexity - can engineers navigate across services effectively?\"\n\n**Trap to avoid**: Don't bash their current tools. Position Amp as complementary or next-generation.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q2: Scale and Complexity Challenges**\n\n**Question**: \"You mentioned in your re:Invent talk that you evolved from a monolith to microservices. When engineers need to make changes that span multiple services - like adding a new feature that touches 5-6 services - how do they approach that today?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Manual context switching between repos/files\n- Losing track of dependencies\n- Long debugging cycles\n- Tribal knowledge (\"only Sarah understands how these services talk\")\n\n**Follow-up**: \"Do your AI tools help with that multi-service navigation, or are engineers basically doing that manually?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: Whether their current tools handle their architectural complexity. If they say \"mostly manual,\" that's Amp's 1M token context opportunity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q3: Developer Platform and API Development**\n\n**Question**: \"Your developer platform hit a billion app uses - congrats on that milestone. For the team building those APIs - Content Query, Design Editing, Tables - what does their development workflow look like? What's the bottleneck in getting new endpoints shipped?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Spec → implementation → testing cycle time\n- Code review delays\n- Documentation debt\n- Consistency challenges (\"each engineer writes APIs slightly differently\")\n\n**Follow-up**: \"How much of that work is genuinely creative versus 'we've done this pattern 50 times, but it's still manual'?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: Potential pilot team and use case. If they mention repetitive patterns, that's Amp's strength.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q4: AI Feature Integration (Leonardo.Ai, MagicBrief)**\n\n**Question**: \"You acquired Leonardo.Ai and MagicBrief to accelerate AI capabilities. How's the integration work going? What's the engineering challenge there - is it more about understanding their codebases, refactoring to fit your architecture, or something else?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Onboarding acquired teams' code\n- Architectural mismatches\n- Technical debt from acquisitions\n- Speed of integration (\"slower than we'd like\")\n\n**Follow-up**: \"When you bring in a new codebase like Leonardo's, how long does it take engineers to get productive? Can they navigate it easily or is there a ramp-up period?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: Whether Amp's Librarian (cross-repo research) and Oracle (architectural guidance) solve real pain.\n\n---\n\n### Section 2: Engineering Culture and AI Strategy\n\n#### **Q5: AI Tool Competency in Hiring**\n\n**Question**: \"In your Fortune interview, you mentioned changing engineering assessments to evaluate how candidates use AI tools. What does 'working intelligently with AI' look like in practice at Canva? What are you testing for?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Specific skills (e.g., prompt engineering, knowing when NOT to use AI)\n- Quality bar (\"we want engineers who review AI output critically\")\n- Strategic vs tactical use of AI\n\n**Follow-up**: \"Do your current AI tools support that 'intelligent use' model, or is it more on the engineer to figure out the right workflow?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: Whether Canva wants opinionated, intelligent AI tools (Amp with Oracle/AGENTS.md) or just raw code generation.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q6: Code Quality and Standards at Scale**\n\n**Question**: \"With 626 engineers across Sydney, Manila, London, Austin, Beijing - how do you maintain code quality and consistency? Are there specific conventions or patterns you want engineers to follow?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Style guides, linters, code review standards\n- Challenges with enforcement (\"we have guidelines but they're not always followed\")\n- Onboarding new engineers to conventions\n- Language/framework-specific patterns\n\n**Follow-up**: \"When you use AI tools to generate code, does the output match those conventions automatically, or do engineers have to manually adjust it?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: AGENTS.md opportunity. If they have conventions but AI tools ignore them, Amp solves that.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q7: Experimentation Platform Roadmap**\n\n**Question**: \"I read your engineering blog about building the experimentation platform in-house. You mentioned wanting to reduce data scientist bottlenecks and enable self-service. What's the next phase for that platform?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- New features planned\n- Technical debt to address\n- Adoption challenges (\"teams still ask data scientists for help\")\n- Platform team size and velocity\n\n**Follow-up**: \"What's the constraint on platform development velocity right now - is it ideas, engineering capacity, or something else?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: Potential pilot team (experimentation platform). If velocity is constrained by engineering capacity, Amp helps.\n\n---\n\n### Section 3: Pain Point Deep-Dive\n\n#### **Q8: Biggest Developer Productivity Challenge**\n\n**Question**: \"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one developer productivity challenge at Canva, what would it be?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Context switching between services\n- Code review cycle times\n- Onboarding new engineers\n- Technical debt accumulation\n- Test writing / maintenance\n- Documentation drift\n\n**Follow-up**: \"What have you tried so far to address that? What worked, what didn't?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: The clearest ROI case for Amp. Focus demo on this pain point.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q9: AI Tool Limitations**\n\n**Question**: \"What are the current limitations of the AI coding tools your team uses? Where do engineers hit a wall and have to fall back to manual work?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Small context windows (\"can't see the full picture\")\n- Hallucinations / buggy code\n- Can't navigate complex architectures\n- No architectural guidance, just code generation\n- Doesn't follow Canva's conventions\n\n**Follow-up**: \"If those limitations were solved, what would that unlock for your team?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: Direct competitive positioning. Map their limitations to Amp's strengths.\n\n---\n\n### Section 4: Buying Process and Decision Criteria\n\n#### **Q10: Decision Process for Developer Tools**\n\n**Question**: \"When you evaluate new developer tools, what's the process? Is it bottom-up (engineers try it and advocate), top-down (you make a strategic call), or something in between?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Pilot approach (\"we usually pilot with one team\")\n- Key stakeholders (CTO, VP Eng, Engineering Directors)\n- Timeline (\"we can move fast\" vs \"we have a yearly planning cycle\")\n- Budget authority\n\n**Follow-up**: \"If we were to run a pilot, which team would be the best fit? Developer Platform, AI Integration, Infrastructure?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: How to structure the pilot proposal and who needs to be involved.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q11: Success Criteria**\n\n**Question**: \"If we ran a 4-week pilot with one of your teams, what would success look like? What metrics would you want to see?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Velocity (PRs shipped, features completed)\n- Quality (code review feedback, bug rates)\n- Developer satisfaction (\"engineers want to keep using it\")\n- Time savings (\"30% faster\" or specific tasks)\n\n**Follow-up**: \"What would make you say 'this is worth rolling out to all 626 engineers'?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: How to design the pilot and measure success.\n\n---\n\n## Demo Storyline (15-20 minutes)\n\n### Demo Structure\n\n**Don't do a feature tour.** Show solutions to THEIR pain points discovered in Q8-Q9.\n\n**Structure**:\n1. Quick context: \"Based on what you shared, I want to show you how Amp handles [specific pain point].\"\n2. Live demo: Real coding scenario matching their architecture\n3. Contrast: \"Here's how you'd do this with Copilot/Cursor\" vs \"Here's Amp\"\n4. Impact: \"This would save your engineers X hours per week\"\n\n### Demo Scenario A: Microservices Debugging\n\n**Use when**: They mentioned challenges navigating across services\n\n**Setup**:\n\"You mentioned engineers struggle when debugging issues that span multiple services. Let me show you how Amp handles that.\n\nI'm going to simulate a bug in a payment processing flow that touches your API gateway, payment service, and notification service. Watch how Amp keeps all three services in context simultaneously.\"\n\n**Steps**:\n1. **Librarian**: Search across 3 service repos to find related code\n2. **Context loading**: Load 10+ files (40K+ lines) into Amp's context\n3. **Oracle**: Ask \"Why would a payment succeed but no notification send?\" - Oracle analyzes all services and identifies race condition\n4. **Multi-service fix**: Edit 3 files across 2 services in one operation\n5. **Tests**: Generate integration tests that cover the cross-service scenario\n\n**Contrast**:\n\"With Copilot, you'd be context-switching between repos, manually connecting the dots, losing your mental model. Copilot can suggest the next line, but it can't see the race condition across services. Amp holds the full architecture in memory.\"\n\n**Impact**:\n\"Your engineers told me debugging cross-service issues takes hours. This took 4 minutes. Multiply that across 626 engineers and hundreds of services.\"\n\n---\n\n### Demo Scenario B: API Development (Developer Platform)\n\n**Use when**: They mentioned repetitive API work or developer platform challenges\n\n**Setup**:\n\"Your Content Query API team ships new endpoints regularly. Let me show you how Amp accelerates that workflow while maintaining your conventions.\"\n\n**Steps**:\n1. **AGENTS.md setup**: Show Canva's API conventions encoded (auth patterns, error handling, validation)\n2. **Generate endpoint**: \"Add a /designs/search endpoint with filters for tags, date range, author\"\n3. **Watch Amp**:\n   - Read existing API patterns from codebase\n   - Generate endpoint following exact conventions\n   - Write OpenAPI spec\n   - Add validation logic\n   - Generate tests matching existing test patterns\n   - Update documentation\n4. **Run checks**: `npm run lint && npm run typecheck` - everything passes\n\n**Contrast**:\n\"With Copilot, you get code suggestions, but YOU wire up the tests, docs, validation manually. And Copilot doesn't know your conventions - you're fixing style issues in code review. Amp generates everything, following your standards automatically.\"\n\n**Impact**:\n\"Your Developer Platform team told me new endpoints take 2-3 days from spec to reviewed code. Amp gets you to reviewable code in 15 minutes. That's 10x faster API development.\"\n\n---\n\n### Demo Scenario C: AI Feature Integration\n\n**Use when**: They mentioned Leonardo.Ai or MagicBrief integration challenges\n\n**Setup**:\n\"Integrating Leonardo.Ai means connecting their image generation models to your existing design pipeline. Let me show you how Amp helps navigate unfamiliar codebases.\"\n\n**Steps**:\n1. **Librarian**: Search Leonardo.Ai's GitHub repos (or simulated internal repos) to understand their API patterns\n2. **Read patterns**: Amp reads their authentication, rate limiting, error handling\n3. **Parallel subagents**:\n   - Agent 1: Build API client for Leonardo's endpoints\n   - Agent 2: Add TypeScript types for their models\n   - Agent 3: Write integration tests with mocked responses\n   - Agent 4: Update documentation\n4. **Oracle review**: \"Review this integration for security issues, rate limit handling, and error cases\"\n5. **Oracle response**: Identifies missing retry logic, suggests circuit breaker pattern\n6. **Apply fixes**: Amp implements Oracle's recommendations\n\n**Contrast**:\n\"Manual approach: Engineers spend days reading Leonardo's docs, trial-and-error API calls, back-and-forth with their team. Copilot can't help because it doesn't know Leonardo's codebase. Amp's Librarian reads their code, understands their patterns, generates correct integration code first try.\"\n\n**Impact**:\n\"You acquired MagicBrief for $22.5M to accelerate creative intelligence. Every week spent on integration is delayed ROI. Amp collapses weeks of integration work into days.\"\n\n---\n\n### Demo Scenario D: Experimentation Platform Feature\n\n**Use when**: They mentioned experimentation platform as a priority\n\n**Setup**:\n\"Your blog post mentioned wanting to reduce data scientist bottlenecks. Let's add a self-service feature: a UI for non-technical users to create A/B tests without writing Python.\"\n\n**Steps**:\n1. **Read existing platform code**: Django models, experiment configs\n2. **Generate feature**:\n   - Frontend: React form for experiment setup\n   - Backend: Django API endpoint to validate and create experiment\n   - Validation: Business logic to prevent invalid configs\n   - Tests: Unit and integration tests\n3. **Oracle architectural review**: \"Is this approach scalable? Any edge cases?\"\n4. **Oracle feedback**: Suggests adding experiment preview mode, rate limiting for API\n5. **Implement suggestions**: Amp adds preview mode and rate limiting\n\n**Contrast**:\n\"This feature would normally take a sprint: frontend engineer builds UI, backend engineer builds API, data scientist validates logic, tests written separately. Amp delivers the complete feature in one sitting.\"\n\n**Impact**:\n\"Your goal is democratizing experiments. Amp democratizes platform development - your small platform team can ship features as fast as your product teams need them.\"\n\n---\n\n## Handling Objections\n\n### Objection 1: \"We're happy with GitHub Copilot\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"That's great - Copilot is excellent at line-level completions. Here's the question: when your engineers debug issues across microservices, or integrate acquired codebases like Leonardo.Ai, does Copilot give them the full architectural picture, or are they manually connecting the dots?\n\nAmp and Copilot solve different problems. Copilot autocompletes the next line. Amp understands your entire system architecture. Many of our customers use both - Copilot for quick completions, Amp for complex multi-file work.\n\nIf you're open to it, we could run a small pilot with your Developer Platform team for 2 weeks. If it's not meaningfully better than Copilot for their workflow, you lose nothing. But if it 2x's their API development velocity, that's worth knowing.\"\n\n---\n\n### Objection 2: \"AI tools hallucinate and create buggy code\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"Absolutely valid concern. That's why Amp has guardrails:\n\n1. **AGENTS.md**: You encode your conventions - linting rules, test patterns, security requirements. Amp follows them automatically.\n2. **Oracle review mode**: Before code ships, Oracle (GPT-5) reviews it for bugs, security issues, edge cases. It's like having a senior engineer peer review every AI suggestion.\n3. **Tool permissions**: You control exactly what Amp can execute - block bash commands, require approval for certain operations.\n4. **Integration with your checks**: Amp runs your existing linters, type checkers, tests. If something fails, Amp sees the error and fixes it.\n\nIn your Fortune interview, you said you want engineers who work 'intelligently' with AI. These guardrails ARE that intelligence - they prevent the hallucination problem you're worried about.\n\nWould you be open to seeing how AGENTS.md works for Canva's specific conventions?\"\n\n---\n\n### Objection 3: \"We're not ready to evaluate new tools right now\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"I totally understand - timing matters. Two questions:\n\n1. When would be the right time to revisit this? Q1 planning? After your next release?\n2. Is there a specific trigger that would make this a priority - like a new initiative, team scaling, or a productivity challenge that becomes urgent?\n\nThe reason I ask: you mentioned in your re:Invent talk that managing complexity at scale is a key focus. If that challenge gets worse before we talk again, I'd hate for your team to struggle when there's a solution available.\n\nHow about this: I'll send over a one-pager specific to Canva - your architecture, your pain points, exactly how Amp would help. You keep it on file, and when timing is right, you have the context ready. Does that work?\"\n\n---\n\n### Objection 4: \"What about security and IP protection?\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"Critical question for a company like Canva with proprietary design algorithms and AI models. Amp Enterprise has zero data retention - your code never leaves your control, we don't train models on it, nothing is stored.\n\nYou also get:\n- **SSO integration** for access control\n- **Audit logs** for compliance\n- **On-premise deployment options** if you want Amp running in your VPC\n- **Tool permissions** to block any operations you consider risky\n\nGiven your AWS partnership and the sensitivity of Leonardo.Ai's models, I'd recommend we do a security review session with your infosec team before any pilot. Would that address your concerns?\"\n\n---\n\n## Closing (5 minutes)\n\n### Summary\n\n**Talk Track**:\n\"Brendan, here's what I heard:\n\n1. [Pain point 1 from Q8] - which is costing your team [estimated impact]\n2. [Pain point 2 from Q9] - where your current tools hit limitations\n3.

Track velocity metrics you care about: [specific metrics from Q11]\n4. Week 2 review: If it's not a clear win, you're out nothing but 2 weeks. If it is, we discuss rolling out to more teams.\n\nI can get you set up by [next week]. Does that timeline work?\"\n\n---\n\n**Option B: Technical Deep-Dive (if needs more info)**\n\n\"I'd love to do a deeper technical session with you and [VP Engineering / Engineering Directors] to show:\n\n1. How Amp would handle [specific pain point]\n2. AGENTS.md setup for Canva's conventions\n3. Oracle in action for architectural guidance\n4. Answer any technical questions your team has\n\n30-45 minutes, and we'll leave time for Q&A. Would [specific date/time] work?\"\n\n---\n\n**Option C: Async Evaluation (if timing is off)**\n\n\"I'll put together a Canva-specific evaluation guide:\n\n1. Your architecture (microservices, developer platform, AI integrations)\n2. Specific pain points we discussed\n3. How Amp solves each one (with demo videos)\n4.
