        "transcript": "Speaker ...5425: hello?\nSpeaker ...9762: Hey, there. How's it going?\nSpeaker ...5425: Let me change the background first.\nSpeaker ...5964: Hi, isuru.\nSpeaker ...9762: Hi there. How are you?\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah, good. Yes, thank.\nSpeaker ...9762: You both for agreeing to meet me. I'll quickly introduce myself and kind of explain why I wanted to catch up with you both. So my name is isuru. I'm an amp field engineer. I'm based out of Sydney Australia. And really what I do is I spend most of my time working with our customers on either the most complex use cases or helping them figure out a new use case or just onboard existing users, things like that, but mostly focusing with advanced users. So I was looking in the grab data and it seemed like both of you are consistently using top amp users. So I guess I just wanted to kind of introduce myself and just understand more about what you're doing your workflows because we're also thinking about putting a guide or an article out. We're still not sure about some of the processes our customers are doing, like how they're using amp. So we're just trying to get the information just to understand. Cool. So maybe I'll just pass it over to each one of you to introduce yourselves. And then maybe we can go through your workflow in a bit more detail.\nSpeaker ...5964: Okay. I think, let me start first. So I'm a software engineer in grab senior software engineer. And then I work for like around four years already. So right now, our task is actually doing some service to service kind of authentications. And then we were exploring a technology called spiffy. So basically… it's like a low level kind of like a logic that allows a service to automatically get some identity.\nSpeaker ...9762: Okay.\nSpeaker ...5964: But so in short, what I'm doing with amp is that we found that there is like an open source code that applies this spiffy, they call it spire. And then there is also a helm chart version of implementing it. They call it harden helm chart. And then now my task is to convert this helm chart into a terraform code so that it can be used within our organizations. So how do I use the amp, I have a multiple id, open up. One is the open source harden helm chart. If there's any questions regarding on what they actually does, how many configs are available, then I will ask this amp to find the answers for me. I have another id open up which is the terraform code. So if there is any, like if I want to like, for example, convert the harden helm chart into terraform code, then I'll ask this amp to like do the conversions for me. And at the same time there's another id open up for the underlying spire source code. This is more in depth like a low level kind of logic. If there's something wrong happening on the harden helm chart, I need to go into the spire into the original open source code to figure out what's wrong. Then I will have another amp there. And I'll ask the amp to try to troubleshoot for me. And at the same time, I have one more id, open up for the testing. So, for example, if I have a readme that says that how to do the local set up, you need to maybe create these resources and then change the config and then apply this resource. And then after you run this resource, you create another resource. It's kind of like a, very long list of how to do stuff. But because it's very repetitive. So I find that gbt works well with this. I can just ask the gbt to just run the readme, and then it can just run everything and output the result for me. If there's any issue, then I ask it to try to troubleshoot. So for me, my task is a little bit of multitasking. If something is running on this IDE, I go and proceed to the other IDE to do other stuff.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah. Okay.\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah, I think.\nSpeaker ...9762: So that's you, it said earlier that going through the readme, you said going to gbt, do you mean gbt? Or do you mean amp, or you actually use chatgpt?\nSpeaker ...5964: Basically, amp.\nSpeaker ...9762: Oh, amp. Okay. Cool. All good. So you have, and when you say you have ides open, do you mean you have the amp cli open for different directories?\nSpeaker ...5964: Different repository?\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah, different repositories, but you're using the amp cli, right?\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah… or the VS?\nSpeaker ...9762: Code extension?\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah. So, VS code? Yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: Oh, VS code extension. So you'll have like four to five VS code instances open and you're going through depending on the repos, you'll kick off one job that could take however long it takes. And then you're going on to the next one, working through the next issue. So you're kind of multitasking multiple agents at the same time.\nSpeaker ...5964: Ah, yes. Nice. Yeah. Occasionally, when I need to generate some docs to upload my findings, I will maybe create another like a personal folder or something like that. And then I ask him to like maybe summarize the observation so far, convert it into like a sop, so that normal maybe on call users knows how to actually install it after we make this public, make this into production. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: Nice. Okay. And then in terms of how, like what about amp, like how are you finding it for? Like this type of workflow? What do you like? What do you don't like?\nSpeaker ...5964: So, I think what I like is that sometimes it is a bit proactive. Like if I ask it to do something, it knows that it don't just follow what I do. Sometimes, sometimes it will try to, okay, you have this error, let me fix this for you. Something like that. If I ask it to follow my readme, it won't just blindly follow it and then say, oh, has an error. So I will solve it, will try to troubleshoot by itself and then attempt to do something different than what's stated in the readme. But I will say sometimes it is a good and bad thing. Sometimes if it goes very wrong, then you have to ask it to restart everything again. So, yeah, and also, I think maybe… you have already patched it. But previously, there is like a parallel task exclusions features. And then I get really, it's not good in my experience because the agent attempts to run all the tasks, all the sequential tasks together in parallel. And in the end, it all fails because they're supposed to be sequential.\nSpeaker ...9762: Oh, I see. So if you ask it to use, I think sub agents is what we call it. So if you ask it to use sub agents, sometimes it will go to the task list, but some of those tasks should have been done sequentially and it didn't figure it out.\nSpeaker ...5964: Yes, yes. But I'm not sure if it's a sub agent because I think it's the same agent that runs multiple tasks at the same time.\nSpeaker ...9762: Oh, I see.\nSpeaker ...5964: Maybe it's a bug or something. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: Is it editing the same file or?\nSpeaker ...5964: They run different cli together?\nSpeaker ...9762: Different cli together. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...5964: But I think there's only intermediate issues. I think maybe you have already patched it because I don't see it runs the task parallel really now.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah. So I think if you want to run something in parallel, you need to ask to use sub agents, and generally, it's pretty good because it'll figure out based on the prompt, what it needs to run, what can be run in parallel, and what needs to be sequential. So, I would recommend trying that also, you mentioned like sometimes it will go wrong and I use the VS code extension. Have you seen the feature? It's a little bit subtle where you hover over your last message and you can see like it has the cut like you can restore back to that point. Have you seen that feature? Yeah.\nSpeaker ...5964: I seen that, but I didn't know I can do that. So, yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah, it sounds handy for if you get stuck into those types of situations, I'm just trying to see if I have an example.\nSpeaker ...9762: I'm just trying to find a long thread that I have just to check.\nSpeaker ...5964: Okay. I found the line. I thought you just, oh, so there's a restore button, and then if I click on the restore button, it will revert everything every change that it does.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah, it should keep track of that. Yeah, give that a go. It might, so you should kind of have the freedom to go, let it do its thing and you're like, ah, you missed the mark there. You can go back but also, you can fork a thread. So you're like, okay, we've got a bit of a plan. This could go either way. I'll you could revert back to here, then fork it and try something crazy and then be like, okay, that didn't work, then come back and then we're like, okay, we'll go back down to this path. So there's some like advanced features you could experiment with. I think I might help your workflow, but.\nSpeaker ...5964: Does it actually does, is it just the file revert the file changes or also the environment as well? It should?\nSpeaker ...9762: Be, from what I remember, it should just be the file changes and the conversation like the context as well.\nSpeaker ...5964: Okay. I think some of my readme commands is actual installations in the local machines.\nSpeaker ...9762: So, maybe that, yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe not so good for your given your it's like calling bash commands and things like that… more useful for like preserving context.\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: Cool. All right. Well, that's cool. There's a few more things that I'll come back to there. But Hoang, do you want to maybe same question to you? If you could give me a little bit of an overview and then go through in some detail about your workflow that'd be great?\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah. So my name is sang. So don't say much, right? I am an android developer. So my, so every day I have to do the android dev for our features. So what I usually do is I'm using android studio and I install the amp plugin like this. You see here, right? Yeah, because I got external monitor. So my monitor is quite big then I will got, I can see on the left in my android studio call like this. And on the right is, the amp terminal like this. Yeah. And I, this is what I prefer to do every day and I, so usually I tapping the problem to do to let it do for my, and I, so we've defined a few custom command like this, like if I want to ask them help me to build the app or help them help me check out new plans or stack my android device. Oh, nice. This one just help me to stack android device and capture the videos to insert and save to desktop for me. A few, a few tasks like for my project specific, like running with the plan or help me to write mr, with my GitHub token, then post notification to the channel, publish something like that. I've got a month for me to do like this… during my development. If I have the new rules, I will tap in here to add them, help me to add into the agent files and also where the custom can make a global level. I mean, that other project also can use my commands… but I think also that three issue I observe is first one is the same with backend when the token, you know, the number of token in raising, right? For example, I saw, yeah, this is a good one is I found that the number of token is quite big. It's about three six eight K tokens. It's quite big in my opinion. But when the number of token used become bigger and bigger, then the arms become raised somehow. It do a lot of things wrongly. Yeah, this is what I observe when the token, when number of token window in raising like I use about 20 percent, 30 percent. I don't remember exactly. But when I observing the number of token used in raising, then the arm become raised for me. It do a lot of things wrongly. I had to stop.\nSpeaker ...9762: I see.\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah. Then what I usually do is when a new token, it become bigger, right? I usually knew like I knew, yeah, it's very important for me that I come back. Yeah, but I can observe that it's become uncontrollable. When number of token become bigger, it do a lot of things wrongly for me. And if I use the arms with the external terminal like this, it's perfect for me in terms of performance. But if I use with android studio, I feel, I think there are two issues I observe. For example, you see like this, I cannot control the buffer, this one they run. You see, they auto run by itself. I release my cursor… here. Then this one run by itself. It keeps running. Yeah, you see like this, it keeps running by itself. And the worst case is I can see this one I meet every day, a lot of time it become, I don't know how to say, it's not get points. Blah blah blah blah. Then it stop by itself. It stop by itself. I have to fork stop and I go to the browser like this. Then I leak this one. Then I copy here.\nSpeaker ...9762: Like this.\nSpeaker ...5425: Then I resume by myself because it lost a lot of contact and it close by itself. If I use amp plugin with android studio.\nSpeaker ...9762: Do you have a thread that you could share with support? Where that's happened? Where like.\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah, today morning, I have, but like today morning, I have, yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: If you find one and you can slack it to me, that would be great because I.\nSpeaker ...5425: think, yeah, I got one this morning. The reason why I open like this because I got to it's blah blah blah. I mean, I don't know how to say, but it look like it stopped. Then it got a lot of noise, blah blah blah, a lot of noise like this and make the laptop making noise with blah blah blah, then it keep, oh.\nSpeaker ...9762: So your laptop's also like working, you can feel the fans kicking in and things like that.\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah, the, yeah, I, the noise is like something like blah blah blah. I have, then it's stuck by itself. I have to close the, I need to click here to close the amp. Then I use the, and I resume the text like this. I go to here. Then I copy like this. Then I then I resume the text by myself.\nSpeaker ...9762: Okay. That's it. I've not actually heard of anyone report that issue. So, so is it that it's still? Like it's still running the inference? Like see, it says running tools, is it something still running? Or it just feels like it's stuck from what you can see?\nSpeaker ...5425: And I try to use now and I, somehow I can predicate for you but it's stuck. So it's and it brings something random. I don't know why, how does it bring something random? A lot of noise, a lot of noise, but, yeah, I hate to force, sorry, my laptop ran out.\nSpeaker ...9762: I see when you say noise, you mean physically from your machine, right? Like like the hardware?\nSpeaker ...5425: No, I don't think, I can use the other like terminal, I can use, I can use browser, I can use slack. I can use the cursor, something like that?\nSpeaker ...9762: Right? It's just android studio, yes.\nSpeaker ...5425: But I still only for the amp here, they got, the stuff, something like that, something with a lot of noise.\nSpeaker ...9762: Okay. Well, let's do this then. So next time because I'm sure it'll happen again, if it happens again, send me a note on slack and then you can share a thread with support. So if you go, let me just check if it's in. If you go to that thread in the website or you do from the cli, I think it's slash share, you'll be able to share a thread with support. And then we can have a closer look as to what's going on there because I'm yeah, I'm sure our team will want to fix that. If we can understand a bit more about it.\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah, if it happens, I will record video and send to you and your slack or something like that. Yeah, by the way, just as you mentioned that we can revert to our message, right? How do we revert here?\nSpeaker ...9762: So, in the cli, I don't know if we have that feature yet. Let me just double check. We're changing like every day there's like multiple releases a day.\nSpeaker ...5425: Okay. You see, the first issue, I tell you, right? I shrunk down but keep zoom. Yeah, you see like this. It cannot at the end. I mean, the cursor here, it cannot keep at the end. It keep zoom back to the it.\nSpeaker ...9762: Goes back to the top. Yeah. Okay.\nSpeaker ...5425: I cannot. Yeah, you see, I shrunk down. It, keep zoom back to the top.\nSpeaker ...9762: Can you press command R?\nSpeaker ...5425: Command R. Yeah, command R, no, it still happen like this. No command R.\nSpeaker ...9762: Okay.\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah. You see this is, yeah, it keep move moving. Yeah, like this, I want to check what is the process like this but it keep zoom back. It's run back to the top.\nSpeaker ...9762: To the top. Okay. I see. All right. Let me ask the team I'll see. So minus this issue and the quality… decreasing as the token limit gets hit, are there parts that you do like about amp? Like what are the things that you enjoy about using amp in your workflow? So, you mentioned the commands?\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah. So I prefer amp compared to the other AI because it's quite lightweight for me. When I use this one and terminal together, my laptop still usable compared to the other AI. When I use the other AI with angular studio, my laptop frequently got hanged. I have to restart my laptop, but this one is not observed with the amp so far. That is why I prefer to use amp, it's quite lightweight for me if I use the terminal.\nSpeaker ...9762: What are the other tools that force you to restart your computer? Like what are the other AI tools? Are they?\nSpeaker ...5425: Can I mention the name? I'm not sure if I can, no, but I'm using cursor as well. If I put cursor at the same time, when I do the task, my laptop got hanged and I have to restart my laptop.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah. Okay. Cool. Because, I guess what I'm trying to understand is so many grab users love cursor and it's a great product. So, like I can completely understand, but for our customers, there's always… at some of our biggest customers. There's always a subset of users who love using amp over cursor. And they're just getting like so much more output as a result. And I'm kind of just trying to understand why these, why the rest of the team don't want to work that way because the output, like if you're using it the way like both of you are doing like you've set up all these custom commands you've set up like this entire workflow? You've got like five instances going at the same time. So I'm just trying to understand like, why do you think people in your team wouldn't… want to use amp and do things the way you're doing. Do you have any thoughts a question to both of you?\nSpeaker ...5964: I think one of the reasons is because we do have some integrations with the cursor, some kind of plugin. So whenever people roll out something, they will say, oh, it's integrated with cursor. And then people will be like, oh, nice. Then I can just use the cursor to do stuff for me. Maybe like what is it called? The API integration stuff? So, yeah, in a way, it's already, the ecosystem is already there. So maybe because of that, it's harder to move to other products.\nSpeaker ...9762: That makes sense. Do you have like an example? So you mentioned like the API type because… like, for example, you're using amp within VS code, with cursor being a VS code fork? Is there like a thing that's wouldn't work in VS code that would work in cursor? Or it is that specific to cursor?\nSpeaker ...5964: I'm actually not quite sure about that because I don't really use cursor that much, but I think cursor has its own IDE if I remember correctly. And then that's right? So whenever there is like a tutorial or some kind of stuff or demo, they show you the cursor way of doing stuff.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah. Okay. You're talking specifically internally, right?\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah, internally.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah, because I'm working with the, I forgot the name of the team but it's like within the platform engineering team in grab, there's a like AI team that helps people migrate projects and they, a lot of their projects have been done through cursor. Now we're evaluating doing migrations with amp as well. So that does sound similar to what they said as well.\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah. I was thinking about that team as well.\nSpeaker ...9762: Oh, okay. Right. Exactly. Okay. Cool. Hoang, what about you? What are your thoughts?\nSpeaker ...5425: For me, I again, the just in my opinion why I use the amp because of the it's lightweight compared to cursor for my laptop, it's an M, this is an apple. M. So if I open the cursor and android store, and if I use, if I do the heavy task, my laptop will only got. M, yeah, the reason why, the most reason why I use amp because of this, is it lightweight for me, it not make my laptop got stuff. Yeah. But one thing is, I feel like cursor is got the better for ides because I can revert the message. And this one you mentioned in M, rather how I can use, with terminal. I don't know, but for cursor with IDE, I can do revert the message.\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah. But this is what I don't found in the amp terminal.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah. Let me have a look. We don't have the, you can fork a thread but you can't revert back. I'll follow up with the team to see if that's something that's in our pipeline and I'll keep you posted.\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah. But for the overrun is I feel like I'm faster. Yeah, it quite fast even faster and not consume much memory of my laptop. Yeah, that's.\nSpeaker ...9762: fair. Okay. Cool. That's to be honest, that wasn't the reason I was expecting to hear. So I'm glad I met with you both because these are two very different workflows to like just the usual stuff we see. So it's really good to hear and understand that a bit more. So pak, is that your first name pak?\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah. Tan, I mean, pak zantan. And then tan, is my surname.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah. Okay. So pak, is that correct? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Pak zantan. So with your workflow, you're kind of you're focusing on the infrastructure side of things you'll kind of have. Do you work through Jira tickets or like what's like the source of your work? Was it like a observability… platform or what do you, where does your work get generated from?\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah. So because… it's a, very big task, so you can say that it generates from maybe like an original idea. And then we change the idea into like a RFC and then based on the RFC after it got approved, then we try to split it down into Jira ticket. I see. Okay. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: So… there's something I wanted to show both of you. Hoang, your work comes from Jira as well. I'm assuming right?\nSpeaker ...5964: In a way, yes, but I won't say we have a really strict rule of like linking a task to a Jira ticket, because sometimes when we want to do something, we do it and then we create Jira ticket, then we try to link it. Yeah, after that. So, yeah, in a way, we're using Jira ticket but maybe not in a standard way, yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: You're not the first person to tell me that sometimes it's like about logging because the work kind of evolves as you do it. So it's about kind of logging. Yeah, that's all good. Let me show you something. So last week, we launched… our SDK… the amp SDK and I think it could be helpful for some of the ways that you both work. Let me share my screen and show you. Okay. So here, I have three terminals and I'm going to execute three scripts, just the same script. But I'm just referencing one Jira ticket in each. So this is the same repository but I'll talk through the code in a second, but all it's doing is it's pulling the Jira ticket. It's referencing the repository creating a branch. I'm using git work trees here. Do either of you use git work trees already? Yeah, I can tell you a little bit about it. So with git work trees, it's a way like the way that branches isolate code into branches, but you can use git work trees to get another level of separation that's at a file system level. It's a really powerful feature. And I think from what I'm hearing, it might help you. So here, I could be working in let's say the dev branch like some feature branch within my VS code, right? So I'm working on this branch here. And here I'm in let's… say for… whatever reason, I'm in the main branch here. So I'm working here. And then in this same solution, I've got three tickets that are being worked on completely isolated. And what I'm doing here is so you can see here, these are the three tickets I refresh. You can see they're moved to in progress. So I'm showing you a solution. But the thing is you can do whatever you want. It's like whatever custom workflows and unique systems you need to connect to the things you're doing already. You can look at automating some of these things by just the cli command like kick off a job that does something. And then if you need to go check in on it later, you can. So like as you already know, like I've kicked off this job, I can go to this right on my phone or wherever and let's go have a look. I can see. Okay, this is what it's doing already. I can check in on it. But ideally the best state obviously, it depends on what you're trying to do is all of these will run it'll, create a PR in I guess in your case, it'll be gitlab, and then I can have a look at that. I can switch branches and keep working there. But the key, the main thing is, you know, you can't throw everything into this thing. You need to break things down into smaller chunks that are completable. I think both of you would already know this, but if you have some simple things that are like, it's a distraction to do that because it's just a small thing. You've broken it down. You just need to like punch away and do it really. You're probably better off like putting that detail in the Jira ticket or wherever you want to have as your source. And then you can put your opinion on like how this should be implemented. And then once this is finished, the way I have it configured, is it'll put a comment in that Jira ticket with the pull request, the amp thread and just a summary of what was implemented. And if we go, have a look at this pull request, I mean it's still running. So for the purposes of speed, I'm just going to show you an existing one and… you know, it'll just have like something like this that you can review and then you can continue on with if you want to. So before I show you the code on how to do this? Is this of interest to either of you?\nSpeaker ...5425: But is this only for in progress? It cannot track the other stuff that like done complete or close. Is it?\nSpeaker ...9762: You can do whatever you want. I just wrote 50 lines of code using the SDK just to show you this example of how you can kick off a job. You could be using it against Jira. You could be pointing to like a markdown file on your disk. You can do anything you want. Let me show you the code first because maybe it's a little bit abstract as to what it's doing.\nSpeaker ...5425: If I start doing something then, yes, you can move the Jira ticket into in progress. But when my PR, my mr got merged, will you can detect and move the ticket to close or done or complete based on the mr starter because I raised the mr, my team review approved and merged when it merged. Consider the ticket is closed complete and done, can your amp can detect this one?\nSpeaker ...9762: I mean, you would need to tap into the webhook event to do that. So if you can, yes, you could do that… but I think it's more or less about like if that's the problem you want to solve, yes, we could probably find a solution to do that. But I think like I saw lots of commands that you were doing already. Like I think if you have tickets that are like things that you've broken down, that you probably start with a command to initialize the project, initialize the repo start doing these things, you could probably automate some of those already while you're working on another branch. So to show you what I mean. So here, I have this execute agent script. So that's all I was calling in those three terminal windows. I'm just calling this script. I'm referencing the amp SDK and I'm calling this execute method. And all I'm saying in this part here is based on the Jira ticket. What repo to use so can is my Jira board. It's like a hash map of all the repos to use. So it could be different for you. I know you have a big one of repos, so it's probably one repo for you maybe, but where it gets really powerful, is this I'm just calling, I have this prompt which I'll get to in a second and I put it into this execute command and I'm just iterating through those prompts. Those are the messages you're seeing in the cli output. And then once it's done, it'll just print it there. And what keeps it all isolated is because I've asked it to clone the repo. So it's cloned it, put it into this repos folder… fetch the Jira ticket. And I'm asking it to use a… work tree and branch. So it'll use git the native git cli command, create a work tree. And then it'll start the work through in that git work tree completely separate to what you're working on now. So you could think of it as like right now we have this threads feature or you could get conflicts because you're working in that's gonna work in your current branch, right? So this is a way that you can work on things in complete isolation. The reason I use that Jira example is it's just a nice way. It's like a common workflow that our customers have. And it's a cool way for me to show you this toolbox feature. So the toolbox the issue with Jira is that the MCP server only works for Jira cloud at the moment. And even when you do set it up, you get lots of pop ups for like oauth and things like that. But what you can do is just specify this toolbox path and you can see in this toolbox folder, I have this Jira tool. So we have this concept in amp of toolboxes where if you wrap particular bits of functionality in these particular methods which I'll show you later in a second, yeah, this execute action and describe action. So think of like any cli command that you use day to day, if you wanna just wrap that up in a tool, you could do that here. I've wrapped up hitting the Jira endpoint. So I'm calling this comment API. I have another one to like move the ticket, progress, transition, the ticket, it's just using the native API. So you just need to bring your Jira API key, and then you can use this toolbox tool. You don't need to have like a custom community MCP server that nobody will trust in the enterprise. So this is like another feature that we have in amp that you can use. So you don't need an MCP server for every single thing. So I guess what I want you to take away from this is less specifically about that Jira workflow but more about automation. Like I think the people who have your type of workflow are the best people who will get the most mileage out of this SDK and what I'm showing you isn't probably where you're gonna land. But if you know that this feature exists and how easy it is to just put a command in a prompt in and have it automate in the git work tree. I'm sure you'll just come up with something better than what I can imagine. Any questions or comments?\nSpeaker ...5425: How we set up the org, the token for the user's red ticket. I mean, how we can, I saw you do the org here, right? And how we provide the token or API key for Jira. Yeah, for Jira.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah. So for in the toolbox in my particular toolbox, I'll give you the code for all of this by the way. I'm just referencing the, I have like a Jira environment variables. So it's how you can use export variables. It's running on your local machine. So it's up to you however you want to run to handle the API keys.\nSpeaker ...9762: So here it's grabbing these from a config and the config is.\nSpeaker ...9762: Load Jira, config. Yeah. So just grabbing that Jira and file this file here.\nSpeaker ...5425: The general idea is this one can help to move the Jira ticket into in preview or in progress. And based on what we change in the mr or in the PR, we will push the command into the Jira ticket. Is it we push the, we push the command into the Jira ticket based on what we change in the gitlab?\nSpeaker ...9762: It will specifically, what it does is like it will like what my one did was it implemented the feature in the Jira ticket and updated the status in Jira from in progress. So this was five minutes ago. It actually implemented the feature… and based on that feature, so this is can three, if I go to can three refresh the page. It… also updated that to in review. And all I did to do that is in my prompt, I just said that's… the Jira issue, move it to in progress. And once it's done like after you do everything and as a part of it, it's like making sure it builds and compiles update it to in review as well. I know you'll have some complex Bazel some hectic moto reaper problem. But the key thing is if you're doing that today, this is all running on your local machine. So just about instructing amp to do what you're already doing.\nSpeaker ...5425: Let's say if I, but it's based on commit, for example, I raise the mr, then my team might review and they have to do some change. Then I commit. Again, will they generate the other description or they update the new? They'll get, the system will not read the new description for the, into the zero.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah. So let's say, sorry, go on.\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah. I mean, if I push the new commit to resolve my college command review command, will it write the new one… in the Jira or they update the existing one?\nSpeaker ...9762: I mean, it's up to you really. So in that case, let's say like when would you be executing your script? If you execute the script, let's say someone left a review, like another example, right? Let's say you've done a PR, someone left a review, you might, and you're already working on like five other things. Now you might just start another CI, not CI job, another job. Or instead of execute agent, it might be like you might have another script called review.\nSpeaker ...9762: And you just put a link to the mr issue and then just locally, the prompt will say, use the glab, cli, pull the latest comments from that, create a git work tree, propose a solution and implement the fixes and then you can review them before it does uploads it. So, anything manual that you're doing today, just try to think of some ways to automate that.\nSpeaker ...5425: Okay. But we have to run the script manually, right? We run the script manually.\nSpeaker ...9762: In my example, yes. But if you have like a webhook or something, yeah, you can do whatever you want. It's all it's all we have. I'm talking to other customers who are trying to wrap this up in like a node app that they host internally. And then other users can call it for simple like they can from within Jira, they can like say at like the way other people are thinking is like this, they'll have a label called he, amp, and if they put the label amp, and then they move it to in progress, then they'll have a webhook that's listening for these. And then we'll kick off a job and then go through that process I showed you. But if it doesn't have that label, it'll ignore it. The key, the thing we're seeing is that some of these off the shelf tools are popping up but they don't work for everyone. And realistically, people like your, that have your type of code bases and the skills that you have are better off just building something that works for your exact workflow. Cause this was what 50 48 lines minus the toolbox, but, you know, like amp does all the heavy lifting with that prompt?\nSpeaker ...5425: Love you.\nSpeaker ...5964: I think I'm not sure if it's supported, but maybe it might be good if they can use the tool based on their needs because from what I see here is that we have to pre generate the prompt, right? So there's no like interactive way to talk to the, to talk with the amp to ask them to perform some kind of fine tuning. I'm pretty sure there might be a way to do it programmatically but maybe if these come in house then it might be better in?\nSpeaker ...9762: Your example, are you saying like if I started this and then I'm like, ah, I didn't like where this ended up. I need to go back open this thread and then work with this in my normal work.\nSpeaker ...5964: Everything again.\nSpeaker ...9762: Not not quite. So like in this workflow. What I would do is I have the amp thread. So, and I have the git work tree. So I just need to open that git work tree which let's see, I'm not sure if there's code oops.\nSpeaker ...9762: Depending on how you set it up, you'll see the work trees as other branches in here. So you can right click open work tree and we'll open to that VS code instance to that branch. And then you can continue that thread. So it will just be a matter of getting that thread id and exactly what Hoang was doing in the, from the id from a website, you can continue that thread with the IDE and then just continue on working through that workflow.\nSpeaker ...5964: But that is after everything has been done, right?\nSpeaker ...9762: That's after everything's been done. But like what I'm showing you here, that might not be the best workflow for your use case. So if you're cause like you're doing like three, four things at a time. So I feel like if there's something you're doing multiple times like the same thing over and over again, there's probably something you can kick off to maybe get something 80 percent of the way before you even look at it, then you switch to that branch.\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah. Actually from my experience, I interrupt them a lot quite a lot because sometimes when you run halfway, I already know they are going moving in the wrong way. So I have to, I have to ask them to like you don't do this and then try with other approach. So I'm thinking if ideally it would be good if, we can attach the tools, into the conversations and then tell them whenever you want. You feel like you want to use the tool, then just use the tool then I,\nSpeaker ...9762: it should still be able to do that. Are you running? You'd have to run it there's a setting that I have like running dangerous on dangerously run all commands or I forgot what it is, cause that will call all the tools that it needs to. Are you, are you running it like that locally? Or are you having it approve? Ask for permission for every step?\nSpeaker ...5964: I, most of the time, I allow all unless for those critically removing stuff then it requires an explicit allow.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yes. Okay. So, I think like from what you've said, it's probably if there's things that need to be fleshed out and you're still guiding the agent, yes, the workflow you're doing is like 100 percent the right way to do it. But if you have smaller things, you've already broken down and like, ah, that's simple that's almost a distraction to what you're already doing, try find a way that you can throw it off to something and then look at it later. That's kind of like the… that's kind of like what I'm trying to propose to you.\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah, I think it makes sense for my task right now is more about researching. So, it quite, is a bit a little bit like exploration. So, it might be non standard, but I think this will be, your use case will be useful for like on call tasks. So, people ask questions and I just copy paste and then it generates all the answers for me and then boom, I just reply the user. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah. On on call tasks, you also can have it, look through git history, find when something was introduced, kind of give you like a report before you even like as you've gotten out of bed probably. So, that's a cool use case, I think to, explore, on call one.\nSpeaker ...5964: Yep.\nSpeaker ...9762: Cool. I'll share the code, with you. You can, you can, yeah, if you have any questions, you can feel free to ask me. There was, just trying to think what else was there? They're they're the main things we do have. We are working internally with some teams to see if we can get a slack bot stood up so someone can ask a question in slack to say like, hey, like how's this API key used? Well, like whatever. And then it'll kick off, exactly kind of what you've just seen. I don't know where that's at, but we're trying to, we're trying to get that stood up. So, we'll see where that ends up, but hopefully, you will see that in slack at some point soon.\nSpeaker ...5964: Cool.\nSpeaker ...5425: So, with the slack bot only for the xero, or it can use for the other context, like, for example, I give them, the code base URL and ask them to do something to do some learning something like that. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: Perfect. Hopefully both, it's, we had a solution that we've been experimenting with, but unfortunately, it didn't work for the grab setup, but now, there's someone else who's trying to build something custom, hopefully using the SDK. So, it's still in progress. I think at the moment, it will be question answer, but I could very easily evolve into like opening merge requests and things, potentially, I can't really comment cause I'm not building that out, but we've internally, we've seen it built out to creating prs.\nSpeaker ...9762: Cool. Well, yeah, any other questions or comments from either of you?\nSpeaker ...5425: I got another question but not related to the xero, you see, I show you, I try take a few, custom command and I put it into the global config,\nSpeaker ...9762: I.\nSpeaker ...5425: dunno, you know, anyway, I can create, I can share this global setting with my team, match something like the contest of MCB, something like, yeah, similar to contest MCB, then the people can reuse what I'm writing for the custom command. Is it possible?\nSpeaker ...9762: I'm glad I was actually going to ask you about that. So, cause at the moment, it's only yourself that has those custom commands, no one else, right?\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah, this is only drafted by me, but I want to share this one for my teammates as well then people can.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah, I believe you should be able to put them into the, folder, within a folder in the repository and it should pick them up. Would you be comfortable putting it in a repo? Like cause you, are you working in an android specific part of the repo or is it,\nSpeaker ...5425: Into the repo. Yes, for now. But if, yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: Alternatively, you could have there you go.\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah, but any way that we can put somewhere else then people? Yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: I think another option is,, you could have another repo that's just full of commands and then, people can pull them into their, into their own, and commands folder, and it'll just be available, on all, on all projects. So, I think if it's something beneficial to that repo specifically, it's good to put it in that repo, because every, everyone will benefit from it. But if you're worried about, you're going to get approved and these sorts of things, then the best way is just to share those and have other people put it directly into their, the folder, same the same way you have, cause they become personal commands.\nSpeaker ...5425: Then… cool. Yeah, but I think that, I want to have something like, similar… to MCP. Somehow, I do some MC, I probably want MCP then, my teammates only need to install it, need to set up the MCP. Then they can use because I don't want to put into my current project, then wherever I change, then I need to, got approval preview something like that.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah, cause if, like, would you, what about if you had another repo, like just for your configuration that you share with your team?\nSpeaker ...5425: Then what they do, they have to pull and push them into the global config, is it?\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah, they'll put it into their, think of it as just if you have a grab amp, commands repo, and then you have a folder for the amp, the android team, and then you have all the best android commands in there. Park, san, might have commands for his team. And then as people, update them or add more to them, you can just pull, refresh them that way. It's not an ideal solution, but that's I'm just trying to think of, what could, what could get you there?\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah, but notice, if I push something change, I ask, I have to ask them to pull, to get the new one, right? If, if, do this approach.\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah, yeah, cause, it's not anything we manage centrally on a server, like on an amp profile or anything like that. It's gotta be on a file system somewhere and get the best way to do it. And if you don't want to do it in the project repo, you could start a separate repo, that has these commands.\nSpeaker ...5425: Okay. Got it.\nSpeaker ...5425: Yeah, thank you. I think about this because I want to, somehow, to share the custom command to my team. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: Let me ask the team as well. I'll see if anyone's come across any creative solutions, I'll let you know if I hear anything better.\nSpeaker ...5425: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker ...9762: Cool. Well, yeah. So, nice to talk to you both. And, yeah, really appreciate your time. We'll I'll share the repo, in slack, and then you can ask me if you have any questions?\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah. So I have one question, maybe kind of like a feature request. So, I think, the command run by the amp is, doesn't have a state, right?\nSpeaker ...9762: So, as in like a bash command?\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah. The bash command. So, so I'm thinking whether it's possible to maybe, have a terminal that records all the state. Otherwise, eventually, the command will be pretty long because sometimes I need to maybe export some variables, but it can't do that. So, what it does is that every request it will export, it will always add the export variables inside. And then sometimes we have multiple variables. And then it gets pretty long. So, yeah, I'm not sure whether you can work on that.\nSpeaker ...9762: So, is the issue, so, is the issue that it doesn't I didn't follow, the amp issue there?\nSpeaker ...5964: Ah, is that because every, every request is running on a new terminal environment?\nSpeaker ...9762: Oh, and then it doesn't have the environment variable set when it's running that bash command. Okay, there is a, there is a good solution for that. It is a bit of a workaround but it works really well is, if you use tmux sessions and you just ask amp to spin up a tmux session, and then, it has access to, send keys, read error, messages, read the logs. Have you, have you experimented with that before?\nSpeaker ...5964: You mean kind of like an SSH, into a terminal?\nSpeaker ...9762: Yeah. So, if, so, for example, let me try to show you real quick.\nSpeaker ...9762: Okay. So, if I go to, let me find the right repo… so not this one… not this one. I think it's here. Okay. So here, so right now, I'm, running in the client npn run dev as an example. I could just ask, amp, start a tmux session called, let's call it grab test, amp, for example, run, from… the client folder, npn run dev. Okay. And on the right, and… I'll say create three paint.\nSpeaker ...9762: Okay. So, tmux, there's a specific syntax which I am not fluent in. So, this is like a great way to get started with tmux. So, here, it's creating a new tmux session. And all it is, tmux is like a terminal multiplexer. So, even when you close the, the terminal window, that session is still running, but you can see here, it's gone, it's sending keys. So, if there's a, an error or a console error within that terminal session, you can just say, hey, look at the left, window in this session, and fix that error as an example. So, here to run this, I just need to type in this command. So, if I go, and start a new terminal paste that in, we can see here, it's got the clients. Did it run it… npn run dev? So, here, it's running here. And I could say, I could ask questions about that tmux session and it knows, so that session's always running. And, that way, once that's set up, you don't need to resend and initialize it with the export keys and things like that. Would that help your workflow?\nSpeaker ...5964: So it doesn't mean that for any following commands, it, the M, will attempt to connect, to the tmux and then runs there.\nSpeaker ...9762: If, not for everything, you just need, you need to tell it, like if you're running a server and that server is going to run, spend multiple threads, you're better off running that outside of amp and telling it to use a tmux session. And then for other things like calling a cli locally, it'll still use bash for that.\nSpeaker ...5964: Okay.\nSpeaker ...9762: So that's something I would recommend, experimenting with, to see if that helps.\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah. I think that's a good idea. Yeah, cause sometimes, sometimes, right now, when I try to run something, it doesn't know that every command is in the, is run in the new terminal. So, sometimes if I try, it will say, oh, let me try to export after export. It generates another terminal say, hey, how come, how come this variable doesn't exist? Let me export again. And then, yeah, sometimes it happens that.\nSpeaker ...9762: Sounds frustrating. I think this will help if it doesn't help, let me know, and I'll see if there's any other solutions.\nSpeaker ...5964: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...9762: Cool. Awesome. I think we're just that time, so, yeah, it was great chatting to you, chatting to you both. Yeah, maybe if there's some big developments, I'll let you know again and we're connected on slack so we can chat there as well.\nSpeaker ...5964: Sure. Thank you.\nSpeaker ...9762: Thank you bye.",

        "transcript": "Speaker ...4968: hey, Jacqui. How you doing good?\nSpeaker ...4968: Ryan did suggest pushing it back to later this week, however, he did not accept this invite.\nSpeaker ...4968: So, let's see. I got the impression that I'm… sorry, I can't recall if you were copied on those emails earlier this week, but I got the impression that he wasn't… quite there but was optimistic with being ready in the near future as he just suggested a few days delay in our chat. At least that's what I'm hoping for. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I mean, fair point getting that plex team up and running and everything like that. I'm sure there's some, oh, he just accepted.\nSpeaker ...4968: Fairly straightforward. I'm going to stand simply. This is like a trial planning session, but, you know, let's see where they're at in terms of updates from him and go from there. That was good. Cool. I'll drop in a copy of the running notes as well, if you don't have it handy. Hey, Brian.\nSpeaker ...0068: Hi, I'm Malcolm. How are you doing?\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah, doing well. How are you? It's.\nSpeaker ...0068: been a whirlwind of what else? Should I say? A tornado over here?\nSpeaker ...4968: Oh, yeah. Geez a tornado outside the usual tornado or no?\nSpeaker ...0068: No, it's the usual tornado right now because of all the changes in layoffs we're still going through unfortunately. Well. So let me give you guys progress. So I filled in the team and our leadership about what you guys want to engage. And then I, which means I have to get lawyers involved and I got lawyers involved because ultimately, what I think, what I want, I think what I remember what we talked about is it'd be nice to say, hey on your website, we're working in intel and we're going to do this whole thing because if you're going to give us so much credits, you're buying something. And so in order to do that like, we don't mind, but I want you to have that ability to be able to say, hey, we're working with intel and put it on your website sort of stuff. So I have that going. Our internal team is we lost three guys. I'm hiring three more guys because they got cpm'd so I'm frantically working with. So I'm trying to give us a five person team. I know Nick has because Nick's trying to help me. It's him and I, we're the architects and we're trying to get a three to four Guy team. So that turns us into Nick, us two and then three or four. So we might be getting five guys on. And so my timelines have been pushed out a little bit. I used, I don't know if, you know, I used a little bit of stuff. I had it help me write up some MVP stuff to kind of get our leadership to go.\nSpeaker ...0068: Hey, we need these people here's. Why, yada. Yada. And so right now, the answer is, yeah, we appreciate. Thank you. We want to do this with you. And I have two parallel streams going on. Does that make sense?\nSpeaker ...4968: That makes sense? Yeah. And appreciate the updates and those three to five guys that's the flex team that you were talking about in our last call, correct?\nSpeaker ...0068: Yeah. And they got fired, you heard that, right? You don't know.\nSpeaker ...4968: Jeez. Okay. Yeah. So they.\nSpeaker ...0068: bad choice of words. We don't use that word.\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah. This was the team that went to, so they were with intel, they went to accenture and then did they get fired again from the accenture apologies?\nSpeaker ...0068: Yeah. So what happened is even though 300 folks, the whole flex group got pushed there's contracts associated because the way it works is flex we hire internally, it's our own internal contingent worker program. If you will, they all had about 300 people had a statement… of works associated with their contracts. Well, what happened is in our industry, in our group, all the contracts got cut. Yeah, gotcha. If there weren't already a signed contract, they didn't get renewed. So what happened, which was a surprise and that was as of like last Thursday or no, well, a week before that, it was Thursday before that.\nSpeaker ...0068: Okay, the point I'm trying to get you is now we have to go find our internal blue people and we've been talking about rehiring one of those guys that's why I say it's tornado. And I'm okay with you guys saying maybe intel's not the right player to do this. I'm fine with that. Really what I want to get to a place, is, this is the ideal outcome. I want to get to a spot where you can see how much money we're spending and so that we come up with a monthly billable or annual billable strategy within our development program inside our government technologies. I would love to see this take to the bigger part of intel. I've already approached our it folks higher up. They're interested. I said, okay, I'm pushing on them and I want to introduce you to them. They wanted me to give them feedback, but I've been kind of playing mixed field here. When I give them my feedback. I'm giving my feedback as a personal user, but I'll let them know that way, right?\nSpeaker ...4968: Right, right.\nSpeaker ...0068: And I'm giving them a feedback from over here. Now, I got to tell you amp, yesterday or the day before helped me find an amazing problem in a piece of code from the staff that left. And, you know, my virtual assistant and I went down the road figuring out what to do is effing phenomenal.\nSpeaker ...4968: That's great to hear. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...0068: You know, I have guys that are going using like copilot agent and I know that that's kind of doing the same thing as amp, but I still, every time I use some of these things, you know, you already hit grok's LLM, or I still say, you know, amp, gets me closer than those other products. I don't know if that's your guys' experience. I mean, I don't know.\nSpeaker ...4968: How to opt that's exactly the goal. Yes, yes, you.\nSpeaker ...0068: Guys, I'm assuming you every once in a while check their products out, yes. No.\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. And, even with grok specifically, we've been experimenting backing in some of their models to use them for specific tasks in amp. So, you know, it's kind of all everything in terms of how the amp product evolves, everything is on the table. You know, very much taking an experimental approach, how we can, how we can make it the best, you know.\nSpeaker ...0068: And I'll tell you guys both that, you know, I might be leading the witness because I want to ask your opinion, but I'll just say, you know, a number of I'm now calling these things virtual assistants really because I hate using the word AI. Okay? And some of the models and some of these models want you to pay more, blah, blah, blah. I get it because they're trying to tell you what you want to hear. But for me, my best virtual assistants is amp from a development point of view. And then I find that grok gives me the most. I don't know. I don't know what you guys are finding, but I feel like grok is it's I don't know how to describe it. I tried him and I've tried a whole bunch and I still try just to see. And anyway, is that what you guys find or you find other blends? Now? Grok, I don't use mainly as a developer. I'm just saying as.\nSpeaker ...4968: Other reasons. Yeah. Just like personally and, you know, when you need, the LLM for whatever it might be. Yeah, I'm keen to hear Jacqui's opinion on this. What I can say is we've certainly heard more about it internally as peaking a lot of the key amp development team's interest in terms of, you know, things it can do. I'm for most of my personal stuff. I'm currently still on like the gpt V and a little sonnet iv V.\nSpeaker ...0068: Yeah. Okay.\nSpeaker ...4968: So, Jacqui keen to hear what you.\nSpeaker ...5905: Yeah. To be honest, I haven't tried grok or like I haven't been using grok in my day to day. We have like an internal team that is dedicated for evaluating models and they're the ones that literally try every new model that comes out that's awesome. Yeah, I don't have the time for that, but, I do, I go back and forth between openai and cloud. Oh, yes. You know, like I'll go to openai, because I still think chaigbt gbt V does a really great job of like more planning type stuff. Yeah. And I like to, you know, think with it more and then cloud I still think is way better for coding and tool calling.\nSpeaker ...0068: I find with chaigbt, I always have to say, please tell me the truth.\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker ...0068: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...4968: Playing them off each other, you know, having them kind of go back and forth and that's the experience in amp, right now, you can kind of they'll check each other's work almost, you know.\nSpeaker ...0068: So, right now, on my own personal projects, I'm actually doing it, I'm training a model and do.\nSpeaker ...4968: Some inferencing, oh, nice.\nSpeaker ...0068: A specific particular thing and I asked amp and grok to kind of help me get started on certain things and I was so impressed with the convergence, right? You know what I?\nSpeaker ...4968: Mean? Sure. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...0068: And what about the other piece? Have you guys been coming up? Because, you know, I hear a lot of lawyers talking about intellectual property that you can't use AI and then it throws it all out. Do you come across that at all in your?\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah, yeah. We actually have with another customer. We were just going through some discussions around, you know, what the state of intellectual property rights, indemnification, and all of this kind of works when you're going for, you know, like if you think about it like hody for example, was a material different product from something like amp because it was, you know, like contained in the context of your code almost whereas you can go to amp and tell it to build anything. And the problem, that then creates is I can go, hey build me Dropbox. And if I'm you know, someone on your flux development team and say build me Dropbox and that comes in under like intel and Dropbox finds out about that. You know, there's a whole different cascading like… chain of liability if you will. So yeah, definitely some like that's cool. The interesting thing I'll say is that like it's evolving thinking across the different stakeholders in this, you know, kind of in this realm, right? So, whereas I think a lot of security and legal teams used to have the final say in this, a lot of companies are realizing that these are different tools and it is very important to get them up and running in their environment, you know? So.\nSpeaker ...0068: That being said, I have, I don't know if you thought of this, it might be hopefully it might be an opportunity for you guys. So what I asked this particular lawyer, I said what if I had my own LLM that I trained and created… I have my own AI interface and it's running in my closed environment. And I ask it to assist me in all that stuff. At what point? Does this area where everything is I own from the beginning? And there's intellectual property and your IP and your copyright that you're creating. And you're using a virtual assistance that originated from your own company. Where does that end? And he goes, his first question is you can run this on your own and I'm like I have no money, you can run power and you can.\nSpeaker ...4968: One of the opioids or something.\nSpeaker ...0068: And he's like, so I said, this is, he goes that's a twist. I'm not sure our firm has even thought about it because again, what I've tried to get at is like if you, I'm very keen where I'm trying to get to is I hope one day your product is in such a way that we could do a closed loop network that we license out so that we can work on top secret product that's.\nSpeaker ...4968: what I'm trying to get at, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker ...0068: The other advantage I'm trying to establish is from a legal point of view by doing this and because things in your closed loop are not being shared and you're using this brain to help you facilitate and not create things from scratch but assist in things, what area does that mean? It's not, why would that not be still your copyright, your intellectual property et cetera. That's what I'm trying to prove a point anyway.\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah. And there's a really interesting like chain of like what would have to happen to even like prove that it was some sort of infringement? You know, like, so obviously, you'd have to be able to track back to the individual person who prompted the LLM to do something malicious, right? And then that code even if it was, you know, like because I can build in the Dropbox example, a file sharing app. What makes it materially the same as Dropbox, right? Like, and in order to know that I'd have to know their code therefore, and then you have the whole step about like does Dropbox ever even find out and press charges? You know? So it's like this whole thing of like decreasing probability, you know? And then.\nSpeaker ...0068: The other thing I said, look at, I wrote a bunch of code and I used an agentic AI and it learns my pattern and again, virtually assists me. But I'm the originator and that you can see the pattern. It originates off what I started with. So at what point would you even know that?\nSpeaker ...4968: I did it exactly, yeah, like. And that is the well, you know, probably in a lot of cases, the 1,000,000,000 dollar question right there, right? Like.\nSpeaker ...0068: And then I got him thinking because he was in the place of the original copilot model where, you know, copilot's looking at GitHub for all of its learning methods, right? And obviously, when you start early on, you could see like pattern chunks coming out like that looks like existing code, nothing to look like a previous pattern that I wrote, right? Yeah. And that's why I didn't like it. I was like, this doesn't feel like the way I would write something amp for me is the first time, you know, I had written thousands, you know, multiple books and novels out of the code I've written, right? And you see it like replicating your style like, you know, jaw drop going holy, shnikes.\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah. That pattern recognition, right? Yeah.\nSpeaker ...0068: That was a bit of a tangent, but literally, I want you to realize I'm trying all these angles.\nSpeaker ...4968: Sure.\nSpeaker ...0068: Because we had our internal lawyers coming back and saying, and I'm saying, look, this is a situation, you know, at what point do you go? This tool VS code I'm using isn't an assistant that you were saying? Oh, because we use VS code to do our work, this tool. Now, we can't copyright it. I mean, how do you know that? I haven't thought of something and I wrote it down and I said, hey, help me finish these things like the fact that I can tell it to go rename something, you know, a 1,000 points just because I asked it that virtual assistant. And instead of me spending the dollars and time to go rename this, find string grip, said replace like, come on.\nSpeaker ...4968: Come on. Yeah. Right. No, no, I hear it. Yeah. No. But to that point, you said a couple of things that I had a few follow up.\nSpeaker ...0068: Questions. Sorry about the tangent. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...4968: No, no, you're fine. You're fine. So, it sounds like the last time we had spoke, you were just going to get Nick up to speed. It sounds like all good, Nick's on board and everything like that. Any questions?\nSpeaker ...0068: Or anything we can help with? Nick is on board. He wants to go deeper with, he wants to exercise and he hasn't had the time, but I've been sharing screens with him. Okay? And so far, I've been hearing like, wow, this is pretty dang good. That's what I.\nSpeaker ...4968: Hear. Yeah, awesome.\nSpeaker ...0068: I know he signed up and has an account and we're under the same team right now.\nSpeaker ...4968: Okay. Yeah. I saw something. I saw his name flash through in one of our internal.\nSpeaker ...0068: But I don't know if he's actually exercised… it without seeing it on my screen or asked it and popped it. Yeah, I don't know yet.\nSpeaker ...4968: Gotcha. Okay. Cool. But.\nSpeaker ...0068: Go ahead.\nSpeaker ...4968: No, no, no, please, yeah, finish the thought, but I was.\nSpeaker ...0068: I wanted to be very clear and open with you because you credited us some stuff mal in there, I have no idea. I don't remember. Yeah, I wanted to make sure you're aware I wasn't taking advantage of that, but I did, no, no, that's what it's there for, you get to do a few things to help me solve, you know, trying to get them to go. Okay. This is amazing.\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah. No, no, that's exactly what the credits were designed for.\nSpeaker ...0068: One thing I want to tell you on Tuesday, it helped me solve something that would take me all week because of what was I going to tell you? The team leaving? And, you know, I don't have muscle memory because I haven't been writing their code, right? And I know I can go find string, go figure out where it all is. And I said, hey, I need to find this. And all of a sudden it goes line 32, blah blah blah here it is click open. And then I said, here's my situation… and, but I think it's going on in here and he goes, oh yeah, yeah, you're absolutely. I love the confirmation bias.\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...0068: Wonderful being… I know, but anyway, but the one thing we sleuthed out together is one of our models, we were, we had to have flying objects that use, you know, GPS, but our model was based on a perfect world sphere and we realized, oh, and I said, oh crap, the world's not a perfect sphere. It's an ellipsoid. And then I had to go down the path of figuring out how GPS does it. And, you know, my virtual assistant and I go, the part that it helped me a ton was the trigonometry because I forgot all my sokotoa. So kind of, you know, anyway.\nSpeaker ...4968: That's.\nSpeaker ...5905: crazy.\nSpeaker ...0068: It was awesome. I was like man, the amount of time it saved me is just amazing. So, of course, I go and repeat the story and I said, but we still need guys.\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah, but between.\nSpeaker ...0068: You and I, that virtual assistant basically replaced the three guys. Honestly. Do you hear what I'm saying? Yeah. So what I, my goal is still convince leadership, we still need more team, but I want to, I want to pair them because I really feel if you have a great architect, yes, virtual assistant, you're worth three people?\nSpeaker ...5905: Yes. Well, that's exactly it because, you know, we feel the same exact way like you still need an architect, a captain of the ship if you will. But now, you have like, you know, a fleet of agents that can do work for you but you still have to have somebody that understands code, knows what good code looks like and can, you know, orchestrate it and architect everything. So you're thinking about that absolutely correct. We don't we don't think that AI is quite there yet where it can like truly replace you.\nSpeaker ...4968: Know people.\nSpeaker ...0068: And my problem, is it comes down to that garbage in garbage out. I think I use it. Yes, if I have a junior dev, I… think it's going to be a hindrance to the outcome of what we want around intellectual property or copyright to be honest, because it's I think just in my mind, don't have that mindset and they're going to rely on some more back to the same thing you said to build me a Dropbox type environment. And I think they're going to be a lot high and that's the problem I need. So right now, I am, I'm pulling back this training program that I have started. And the Guy I was report, we're going to tell he moved out of the group. He actually, you may be moving out of the company, but that, that's where. So I said it was actually a good thing because I started realizing that we need to have this architecture architect type mindset paired with the virtual system. But also through training and attrition of new people coming on, how do you help a junior dev grow into that architect person? And so that's currently a kind of a project I'm working on to write up this sort of overview. As as we bring in developers into our organization. How do we go through a process of molding them into this style? That's all I'm trying to get to.\nSpeaker ...5905: Yeah, no, it's you're thinking about this the right way and I think this is like, a new problem, you know, like,\nSpeaker ...0068: we've.\nSpeaker ...5905: never been in this situation before, but yeah, it's I think you're so, right?\nSpeaker ...0068: And I, right now, like, the devs that we had that were at our flex team, some of the folks would call them senior developers. And I, I'm a little bit harder. I would call them developers. We had one junior dev and a developers, but they were paid at a senior developer. I gotta be honest with you that's all relative to intel's software development. Intel's, not a software company. So, that's why I say it like that. They excelled at, you know, where they were versus others. However, you know, if I paired them with the agent, you know, amp, I think they would be, do a good job, but I would need to spend some more time coaching on how to describe their things and hold up those classes with them, in some of the things I've learned and how you just say, my biggest concern is always this. I don't want the virtual assistants to create things from scratch because then the person doesn't learn anything and they don't know really how to read back and understand, I, I'm trying to create, a, you know, cascading effect, a waterfall effect. I don't wanna program that like, I don't mean that in an agile version, a lot of it. But what I'm trying to say is this is how that architecture versus have to work together. This is how a senior developer, and I almost wanna say junior developers, you know, you're only allowed to, you know, do this much and I don't even know if I can, I bet you, I could ask, you know, say, hey, this user who logs into this only limit to this type of urban?\nSpeaker ...5905: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...0068: But anyway, you get what I'm getting at, right? I'm, trying to… okay, so that's what I'm trying to put together, as a white paper, slash actual program for within and inside intel.\nSpeaker ...5905: Just so you know, as well, for the trial, I know that's going to be a smaller crew, but, we will also offer enablement. And if you do at least purchase, the five K, minimum, then we'll offer more enablement as well as people on board. So just examples of like workshops that we could present or potentially do would be, agents MD file, how do you make sure that you have good agents MD file? You know, like context engineering and MCP tool calling, you know, prompting like it's really honestly, whatever appeals to you guys the most, but we have like, yeah, different workshops that we can offer. Well.\nSpeaker ...0068: That'd be amazing. We'll pair it with that. So, I'll keep that in mind. So, as a terms of timeline and where we execute getting, you know, a five K monthly or more, based on our current trajectory of certain things, you know, it would be nice to say we could sign something by Christmas, right?\nSpeaker ...0068: And then, you know, the end of the year with signing up until let's just shoot for that as an, a goal, but be real, I want you to be realistic. I don't know what I don't know, but I bet you the new year would be, I'm pretty confident first quarter, we'll probably get some of that. I'm just telling you how the domino effects and how much tornadoes is going on. So, what I want you to hear, is, I want this, my, cohort architect is a senior PD, wants to include this, I'm projecting that we need this as a way to save money, with people who hold the purse, they like that, I'm, I'm now getting the lawyers and I've already got the lawyers of all, I want the lawyers involved so that you guys can actually use our name, to say an announcement of say, hey, also used by so, and so company on your website?\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah,\nSpeaker ...0068: I just want to make sure, did I misread though you, the whole, what you're let me step back was that your intent about doing this program is to say, announce that or not? Did I misunderstand?\nSpeaker ...4968: So, it's always something we're, interested in, yeah, whatever we can,\nSpeaker ...0068: If we can't do, it doesn't hold you back. Is what you're saying?\nSpeaker ...4968: Exactly, exactly.\nSpeaker ...0068: More importantly, you want to basically secure a monthly or annual basis with us at minimum, would be the ideal scenario.\nSpeaker ...4968: Our, our ideal even right now is to, get you stood up with amp, even if it's at a, our minimum threshold is five K and that's not monthly that's just five K credits, you know, so basically getting, reading between the lines, sort of long story short here, we are confident that once people start to use, amp, like you have yourself that, it kind of grows naturally. So, our main goal is to be able to, enable that. And obviously, within a company like intel, there, there's going to be the legal paperwork. There's. Going to be the budgetary signups and stuff like that. So, getting through those hurdles is sort of, our,\nSpeaker ...0068: focus, we'll take this as a parallel point because I think I made up something in your requirements and not realizing that's what you know, I meant. So, I'm glad I said that parallel effect, piece. We'll get the legal stuff going just so. And if they say no, fine, it has happened by the way that's why I'm bringing it up. The other side, is let's get to that place where we contractually get the place where intel's paying you guys sound good?\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah, that sounds good. Okay. Yeah. So, and given those tweaks is, does the Christmas kind of goals still sound about right? Or? Yeah.\nSpeaker ...0068: So that's why I wanted to add on, I don't think the lawyer side where you can announce something is by Christmas.\nSpeaker ...4968: No, that's fine. Yeah, that's fine. I figured as.\nSpeaker ...0068: much that the money, having greenbacks is more important as a company than, you know, but, I didn't want to add that as your requirement for the, I don't you guys mentioned, you know, I don't care if the number has changed, but for me, I always felt like, wow, that's very generous to offer. We got to give you more back, right? In some way. And that's why I think I brought up the idea of at least announcing something marketing wise, but, I may have what I'm trying to reiterate is I may have created that stipulation and you guys didn't okay. That's all I'm.\nSpeaker ...4968: trying to say, no, no, that's yeah, yeah, no, it's I mean, we love logo rights. Don't get me wrong, especially if it's something like intel, but, but yes, just to, from our perspective, it is not like, a requirement of that unlimited trial. The only thing that I will say about the unlimited trial and obviously, you know, we can denigle this and work around with it a little bit is, from our leadership's perspective, the, one of the big drivers of being so generous is to try to incite velocity with it. So they basically look to set up those trials, and ask for a decision shortly after. Now, appreciating that there's yeah, you know, there's parts here. Intel is not, you know, an SMB company or something like that. That is, that is, you know, we're talking directly to the CEO or something. So the only thing I would say and it sounds like with, you know, getting these other three to five people in, is we'll probably just want to think a little bit about when it would make sense to enable that unlimited trial. And I know last time we had talked about mid October, maybe that's more like, you know, mid November or something like that and.\nSpeaker ...0068: You know, we might win the deal just from Nick and I, by the way.\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah. And that's you know, that is so that, the credits that we've given you right now, use those to your heart's content, you know, and if that's what?\nSpeaker ...0068: I want to.\nSpeaker ...4968: Hear.\nSpeaker ...0068: Yeah, yeah. I don't want to wait for, let's just make this sign of like not parallel with trial. What I… mean, is I don't want to stop and let you guys wait. Like if you wanted to do this whole, multi person, great, we'll try that. I don't want that. I would, if we could win with just Nick and I fantastic.\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah, yeah. I'm.\nSpeaker ...0068: going to push, I'm, going to push, okay, regardless of whatever it can. Awesome. Does that sound good?\nSpeaker ...4968: That sounds perfect. What can we do in terms of, you know, like, I, if I'm not mistaken. I shared some of our AI terms. Do we, I can, draft up a, like an order form, what that would look like so we can get some red lines going back.\nSpeaker ...0068: Why not? Why don't we do that? So here's… what I want to feel comfortable from a moral point of view, because I like the whole give and take. I was sort of putting things, not trying to hit it hard because I wanted you guys to feel like you were getting in something, but I'm just going to repeat, is it okay if Nick and I hit it hard with some real development? And then we could use that as fuel to say, look, this is what we were able to accomplish. And without this, we weren't able to do it. I did it on Tuesday, but if I can have a secondary cheerleader like go use this, go do.\nSpeaker ...4968: This, yep. Yep. And.\nSpeaker ...0068: I don't want anything to hold us back is what I'm saying and I want you to feel comfortable and I want to feel comfortable that I'm, getting permission to go and do this because you guys gave us credits. I mean, it's been spending money. You go with that. Yeah?\nSpeaker ...4968: No, that sounds great. And, you know, like I think the, I think the fact that this is real work, you know, is real work, real proof points, real use cases, et cetera. Something tangible to show, is like music to our ears kind of, you know, we find that, these work a lot better when we can, you know, pan, real business value back to whoever signed that check, you know?\nSpeaker ...5905: And just to be clear, like it's just time boxed. So, I'll like you have some credits now that you can still mess around with. But if you want to hit it hard, just tell me when you want that start date to happen, and I can load your workspace with like that's what we're allowed to do, of credits and then hit as hard as you can for two weeks and then I have to zero you guys out. Yeah?\nSpeaker ...0068: Understood. Okay. Here's, what I want to do is I'll make a I'm going to let Nick know, let's kind of get moving forward and not really wait for, hiring the folks. And then maybe we can hit it hard with the credits we have now. So you don't even have.\nSpeaker ...4968: to give us more.\nSpeaker ...0068: And then if it becomes the place where I'll send you guys a name. Hey, we want to continue hitting it hard. We haven't hired anyone. Let's just hit this program right now and then we'll elevate and show the results and let's just attempt to do with what we have. Now. How about that?\nSpeaker ...5905: That sounds good?\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah. And then, you know, obviously, as things evolve and stuff like that, where, you know, this is exactly how we want these relationships to go, right? So, you know, let's chat about it. Let's let's keep the lines of communication open, whatever we can do to facilitate that.\nSpeaker ...4968: You've got, it looks like the full 25,000 credits at the moment remaining. So, yeah, that's those are, go to town. Yeah. So.\nSpeaker ...0068: I was just holding back but I'll just say, go do it. Okay. Cool. Is there, do you guys give, pricing wise if you buy more credits? Is there like bulk pricing or better pricing if you buy more? Okay. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...4968: Yep. Yeah, we, we start at discounts at around, 25,000 annual commit. And then, you know, once you get up into, into the kind of like three to 400,000 dollar range, those, that's when you start getting into like, the more significant sort of things, but it's a table. It's it's a fixed thing. I can share that with you that's no problem. Okay. And generally, you know, I'm, asking for two reasons. Okay, personal side, yeah.\nSpeaker ...0068: And then this, yeah.\nSpeaker ...4968: So, and then, yeah, right. Yeah. Hey, if the nova eight stuff, if, if you want to do something over there too, that's a problem as well? Well?\nSpeaker ...0068: No, no, no. I meant, in terms of the, you know, yeah. Yeah, I don't even think I'm, I, you know, I think I spent over a 1,000 or whatever, but, I'm wondering what it, what those breaking points like shoot? I just buy a bulk section if there's a good brand, I might spend five grand just over there, just right?\nSpeaker ...4968: Right. Yeah. Yeah, that's, yeah, yeah. So, all of that, all of that stuff is like, and one of the reasons why, we, you know, kind of focus on, that five K starting point is one, a lot of companies don't really know how to use some of this stuff, and, you know, us enabling a smaller investment, you know, sort of tipping towing into it. Has proven to be helpful. But the other thing is, that gives us a bat in concert with, you know, the credits we've already given you if an unlimited trial makes sense, gives us a very good understanding of like what the usage proof points are in a given day. So we can go and say, hey, this is a like a real con, contextual estimate of what we think your developers are going to use over time and therefore, where we would recommend starting in terms of like a larger commitment to unlock those discounts. So, it's all sort of like, it's intentional to enable the realities of the situation with agentic tools and, to make sure that it's you know, like, the one thing we don't want to do is say, hey, you're enabling 400 people with this, we need 400 licenses. We don't know how much they're going to use them, but we're going to charge you 100 bucks a month for those licenses. You know, so we're kind of like the anti, that, which is, it has driven a lot of decisions around how we, you know, one structure, our pricing for this, in the consumption basis and to, you know, how we're approaching starting this growing and partnering with, with people going down this pathway with us?\nSpeaker ...0068: And throw a curve ball. I see we're seven minutes over. I can go over a little more. Are you guys?\nSpeaker ...4968: Good or no? Oh yeah. Jeez. Yeah, yeah, I'm good. Yeah, thank you.\nSpeaker ...0068: I… don't know in my group, what we do a lot of stuff is for edge and battery operated devices, whether they're mobile or on the ground or wearable. But we are exploring right now and twofold things is a small, you know, micro, you know, llms that were micro, devices, and we have sort of scenarios where we're asking querying questions on machines that are using nine watts, right? And, you know, the responses aren't, are good enough and what it's doing. But I don't know that you, this might not even be part of your business strategy, but I'm throwing it out there because there's a lot of things we do that even from, a person that may require some quick code fix in field. And I want to throw this out there because I, we, I mean, we have new technology that we're working on where you're doing a massive amount of compute in a half watt. I know that sounds amazing. Crazy, but we were doing object detection models that were able to identify and replace certain things they saw in the scenery in a matter of seconds on a half a watt. Okay. So, there's opportunity here. If you don't go this way, I know, I'm not, I'm just throwing it out there that there could be more of a joint white paper ever because the genetic stuff that I've been seeing there's two things going on object detection, doing something. And then there are scenarios where actually code has to be fixed in the field in a very situation, very quick situation. And in my mind, I think there needs to be a couple brains if you will virtual assistants within the system to be able to do that. And, we're testing out all the image detection stuff. But I'm like imagine you have somebody sitting there and working on a fuel line that they see that there's a software problem, but it's a light threatening situation. And I have a mobile device I've got, you know, roughly, you know, to be able to do something. The tops isn't amazing. But it's good enough. And I asked it the question to look at my software, what can you help me patch or do? And it does it in the background? And so, I don't know what sizes you guys are at, but this is this I'm currently working on this. And the second thing I'm working on is a horizontal scalable architecture that in proximity to other devices, your tops increases. So, imagine being able to spread, we've successfully been able to, split tasks or, over multiple small edge devices for a single request to increase the tops, like we have a shim layer to do that, and spread your LLM processes through machines and yada. Yada. So, I'm just throwing ideas at you guys. Well.\nSpeaker ...5905: Actually, we're, we're already working on background agents. We're actually really close to like making it more widely available for people to try. But, yeah, like where, we're experimenting right now with like remote background agents that like you could from your cell phone, open an amp session, and tell it to do something and it would remotely use like one of our servers to actually execute the tax and come back to you with an answer.\nSpeaker ...0068: Beautiful, which is one thing I forgot to add. In all that scenario, they're disconnected from the interwebs. What I just, oh, okay. Gotcha. So, it's like all of that I just described on all that energy and walk and detection and LLM all happened. Disconnected.\nSpeaker ...5905: Wow, that is a harder thing.\nSpeaker ...0068: For that. Yeah, yeah, I know, and I'm throwing it out there because we, this is what we call D deal like a disconnected disaggregated, it's a type of term, right? Or basically on premise. But the important part I want you to hear we still did the level of detection in that, you know, agnostic, you know, agentic AI stuff on a half a lot.\nSpeaker ...5905: That's impressive.\nSpeaker ...0068: And then, you know, around, you're starting to get really good response time. Yes, it's not as fast as if you were connected to, in the server room, but it's good enough in these scenarios. Okay? But the agentic AI has been the most promising in our test cases. And that's why I've said there's two things here. Imagine where you say so and so come stand next to me so I can make this decision happen faster and so, or a group of drones that are in flight, you send more. And so I really wanted you to hear this. I forgot to say it's all disconnected. The asian idea is a great idea. Please go down that road. And all I'm seeding you guys with is it's an opportunity not asking to change your business model, you probably need to get revenue based on what you're building. But if there's something in mind and you come back and you brainstorm and I know for sure there's joint effort contracts with multiple companies. Yada, yada, just another avenue that, you know, we're doing proving points right now that this is possible with certain, you know, I know I've seen llms, but I keep, you know, is it small or micro? I'm now trying to change them where, you know, some of the footprints are like 800 megabytes which is pretty dang small for, you know. But I'm not trying to tell you to change. But what I'm trying to tell you, I hope you my rambling here is there is the, I still say, you know, from the breadth that I've been using your agentic AI processing is the best. And if we can extract in certain situations some mechanism to repair Bam, right? And this happened by the way, this is a real use case that I used on Tuesday to demonstrate how I can modify a problem of communication of positioning with the drone and how I said, I need you to prepare this, what happened and it made a small patch to fix it to act like. I don't know what it's going on. I said this is my symptom help me figure out what's going on and it says here's the patch, would you like me to look? So, imagine an operator being able to do that in field? That's what I'm trying to get at?\nSpeaker ...5905: Yeah, no, got it.\nSpeaker ...0068: So if there is at all interest, I mean, there's right now, there's a 908,000,000,000 dollar wow.\nSpeaker ...5905: Well, I was going to say Brian, we have field engineers and four deployed engineers and if the price is right, we'll make anything happen.\nSpeaker ...0068: Okay. So this is all interest, please take it back. Let's go back because right now, I'm doing demos, my colleague is doing demos with the part of hey, the small little handheld device. I mean, teeny, it runs forever. It just looks over here and it says what type of craft is this? And it'll come back and tell you this or it looks at an infrared thing. Just all these things. And part of this controls different flying things. I got to be careful. So, what I'm trying to say is there was a situation where we had a flying thing in negative space and it halted in flight, like where am? I? And I, and then now I virtually took back the problem and symptoms in my virtual area. I said, okay, I'm an operator here's, my AI, my input interface. I tried to act like somebody here's. What I'm seeing going. Can you figure out what's going on and boom.\nSpeaker ...5905: Wow.\nSpeaker ...0068: Like, you see where I'm going with this? So.\nSpeaker ...5905: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...0068: So, in field fixing problems, because there's going to be software problems all the time, right?\nSpeaker ...5905: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...0068: Okay. Enough. Said, if it is all interest on this too, please come back, cool. You know, these are real world scenarios going on right now that we are trying to solve using virtual assistants on handheld wearables, anything you can imagine, and we're trying to make our software, our hardware fast enough good enough to do the job. But the power, you know, envelope low. Okay?\nSpeaker ...5905: Cool. Yeah, yeah, no, that's we appreciate the insight. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...0068: Cool. All right. Thanks for your time. Awesome. Thanks for everything. We'll keep in touch.\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah, I will, you know, let us know what we can do, how we can help start going to town on those credits. I will get that order form ready. We have a very capable and friendly team legal counsel who's happy to hop on calls and stuff like that. You know, if, we need to get the lawyers talking or anything like that just to get this initial over the line. And yeah, we'll just keep in touch go from there, you know, we can have these chats as they make sense over the next couple of weeks here and see what we can get together with the initial. And then obviously, we'll grow from there.\nSpeaker ...0068: Yeah. And one more thing you didn't hear this part. I don't want to use someone else's LLM to do the code writing as, you know, I've been pulling down to get this if we get a small slice and remember, we licensed it everywhere and it's being used. Imagine that. And I'm trying to get it.\nSpeaker ...4968: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...0068: If you made a separate product line that was less mature or something to solve this, that could be big opportunity. Happy to have your, whoever you need to talk to hear all these lists of things we're doing with the number of, you know, the US navy, the air force. I mean, it is insane how often how much I'm doing on this, okay?\nSpeaker ...4968: That's incredible. Yeah, no, sounds great.\nSpeaker ...0068: All right, guys. Oh, yeah.\nSpeaker ...5905: Thank.\nSpeaker ...0068: you. Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker ...4968: Have a good weekend. We'll be in touch soon bye.",

True?\nSpeaker ...7161: Not quite four 30.\nSpeaker ...8537: Four 30. Alright. Still civilized time to be at work.\nSpeaker ...7161: Yeah, true.\nSpeaker ...8537: So, I see that you were in Las Vegas for etls. I was there absolutely.\nSpeaker ...7161: A.\nSpeaker ...8537: little bit.\nSpeaker ...7161: It was amazing eye opening.\nSpeaker ...8537: It was an impressive show. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...7161: It's so good and not enough people. I have the feeling at these other conferences, there are 4,000 people and it's bullshit content. And then you have good content and you have only a 1,000 people, not even… interesting.\nSpeaker ...8537: Well, I don't know, maybe I don't know if the content would have improved or suffered with more people. True. It's nice to be able to go to a conference that's not, I'm going to Aws, reinvent in. I guess it's the first week in December, you know, which is 60,000 people. So, yeah.\nSpeaker ...7161: Crazy, right?\nSpeaker ...8537: A little bit larger hard to get anything done. It's nice when you can see people and then find them again.\nSpeaker ...7161: True.\nSpeaker ...8537: Ivan. Good afternoon. How are you?\nSpeaker ...7733: Hi, Tom. Hi, Philip. I'm doing great. How about you?\nSpeaker ...8537: Good, good. It's good to meet you all. Ivan. I may have shook your hand at atls, I'm not sure I was talking to Steve yege in a hall and I feel like you may have come by and said hello to him, but I didn't realize that you're a partner until he explained that to me later on. But I'm at sourcegraph. I am based in San Francisco and at sourcegraph. I'm responsible for our partner ecosystem. And so that's inclusive of our in club relationships and our software vendor relationships, but I think most importantly, our… systems integrator and consulting and resale kind of relationships. So that's how I got connected up with you all via Brandon. I know that you've spoken to a number of other folks over here, but wanted to introduce myself and talk about how we can get you all, what you're interested in and how we can get you all what you need and hopefully do some business together.\nSpeaker ...7161: Good idea. Nice.\nSpeaker ...7733: Sounds great.\nSpeaker ...7161: Ivan, so you're invited, I think so, what was your thought process?\nSpeaker ...7733: Right. So we currently working with couple of big customers and all of them need AI for different purposes. One of the use cases I see for the banking client I'm working with right now is to generate test scenarios and test automation for their software using coding agent. And that's where I would like to have a bit of brainstorming and how we can enter from these… sort of angle, right? I also like why I would have the first scenarios test because this is banking sector. They have the classification of information. They have four levels of it like public internal classified and strongly classified, right? When we're talking about code, nobody cares, right? There is no person identifiable information. There is nothing there like you just run the tests, cover your application, you're fine. So they have couple of systems in place already. They using gemini which they do not provide directly but they provide it through their own application. They deploy it to user interface. You cannot use it as API. You can only like copy paste things there, right? And they provide personal licenses to internal employees for gemini cli that's also in place already. So they have at least one agent. So to get in there, we'll have to convince them that a amp is better than gemini cli, right? Because it's already in place and we'll have to have a very strong use case there. Like I would say, we go with testing if you have better ideas, let's discuss it like that's. Where I'm coming from.\nSpeaker ...7161: So basically, for your background, Tom, we have the largest German bank, we have the largest German company who manufactures white label fridges and ovens and stuff like that like Ge in the us and we are having AI workshops with all of them. Basically what we did at the elts with gene Kim on the first day, the wipe coding workshop, we are doing for all our clients constantly. Basically. And obviously… amp is a great idea to implement. And I think we talked with the people on the conference quickly about running it even for deutsche bank. If they would jump at some point that I think that's half a year in the future to start convincing them. But if they would jump on one point to even think about how this is a custom development for them because it's a 90,000 people shop, right?\nSpeaker ...8537: Yes. And I mean, we rarely see people want to adopt something broadly to begin with. You know, we oftentimes see that a pocket of people will get going. And so that first customer that first customer is deutsche bank or someone else. Correct? Okay. Yeah. I, well, and let me just backing up. Can you tell me? I apologize that I've not done more research on xalt. I'd love to.\nSpeaker ...7161: Yeah. Let me, yeah, let me give a wrap up who we are. Yeah. So I don't know. Do you know how were they called Ivan, which was on the conference, the leads, how were they called the other partner? I don't know what you're talking about. Liatro? Yeah, liatro, have you seen liatro? Did you talk to them?\nSpeaker ...8537: I did not know them before, but I did talk to them. Okay. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...7161: Okay. So we are basically, we figured out with liatro, that we are the German copy of liatro. Basically. Oh, so that's what we figured out there. So we are helping our clients in devops CI CD pipelines, AI implementation, everything around coding sdlc process, have a strong partnership with atlassian and are mainly located in Germany with 50 people in Germany and five people in the us right now. So we are expanding into the us and liatro is expanding into Germany very slowly and small. So we basically thought we should talk on tomorrow. We should talk to joint forces or something like that. So basically, we are driving this innovations and we are inside our customers and Ivan, you have not heard it yet, but I think I got us the AI workshop with it leadership up to the Cao from sehi yesterday in bsh. So we will have an AI workshop there. So basically, we are the external innovation department which have time to look at new things while they are struggling to keep the lights on. That's how you could see us basically.\nSpeaker ...8537: And are you sometimes doing AI only and sometimes doing CI CD kind of devops stuff only?\nSpeaker ...7161: Everything they want. Basically, we only use AI now for everything and always sneak it in there. So it's always AI included and it's always some devops included, but it's always now under the AI world, when we do new projects, it's always an AI project and has also devops parts, but right? It's never that we are coming from a devops angle anymore, I think.\nSpeaker ...8537: Got it. And did you start it as atlassian consultancy? Or did you start?\nSpeaker ...7161: We started on Phoenix project. When the Phoenix project book was written, we started the company on devops basically, but on the side, we did always atlassian consultant because it was always a Jira in the mix, basically, right? Sure.\nSpeaker ...8537: Sure. Yeah, very interesting. That's super helpful. Let me if you will. Just while I'm sitting here, I should do this. I'm just going to look up deutsche bank. I believe, I know who the account executive is.\nSpeaker ...8537: Nope. We have lots of.\nSpeaker ...7161: How big are you guys at the moment?\nSpeaker ...8537: Yeah. So we are about 200 people as a company, as you say, maybe you get some of this from Steve yeagy or the show. You probably didn't actually, we started as a company… about 12 years ago and we started as a code search company. And so we need to search all the software source code across your enterprise. And that was inspired by functionality which is available internally to developers at Google. It's not a productized offering. But our two partners were palantir, and they were working on large financial services companies, code bases and they said, hey, if we had, if we had that thing they've got at Google, this would be much easier. One of them had interned at Google. And so they said, why don't we build that for everyone else. And so I think the code search product indexes… all of the code, which is a very different problem than indexing other types of assets. And we… built a code search business and ultimately is driving developer productivity developer onboarding, familiarizing yourself with new code bases, of course, reuse of code, making batch changes to code, what we call code monitoring, so you can monitor and track what is in a code base. You can search, you can track over time. And so when two and a half years ago is the model shops become clear, what the model shops were doing, we started working on AI coding assistance, and our first sort of generation AI coding system is called Kodi, and it leveraged that index to provide more context to the llms. Amp is effectively our second generation AI coding system. And so we've got a lot of existing relationships with large enterprises, that are code search customers. And then of course, a lot of overlap with that with our amp code base. And then of course, a lot of new amp kind of customers. Oftentimes, well, you see very rapid adoption of amp in individual developers. We see very rapid adoption of amp in small enterprises. You'd see a faster adoption of amp in large enterprises than you would see perhaps with a, than you would see perhaps with a traditional kind of software product. But you also do see, you know, they want to be careful and go through infosec and those types of things. Now, I'm not as you talk about that, I'm not certainly scared of an account like deutsche bank. We've got, I want to say we've got four of the five top financial institutions as code search customers. We've got at least one as an amp customer. And so, we, you know, have been through those types of security teams and audits before we have, you know, we've been through that kind of, you know, been through that kind of stuff however, you know, it's hearing you talk about gemini, not a massive surprise. And actually, it was funny to, we all commented atls how everyone said, oh, we already own copilot and it was kind of like, you know, Microsoft has sprayed copilot as part of an Ela and people kind of said, yeah, we know there's some other stuff out there but it's so hard to get anything adopted that, you know, we're kind of good with copilot. And that was all very interesting to us because we were saying, oh, copilot is such an old, you know, kind of technology. And then we certainly see and it's crazy to say because it's a brand new technology and most technologicals from timeframes, but right now, it's pretty dated. And then we do see that organizations, I mean, they've adopted duo, they've adopted, you know, Aws Q, gitlab duo, they've adopted Aws Q, they've adopted, you know, gemini, which I think most anyone would, you know, it'd be hard for anyone to argue that those products are very competitive versus the state of the art which is available right now. Nevertheless, you know, they enjoy, you know, distribution and strong relationships. I'm not surprised to hear that gemini is in there, but that's a, you know, a product which we differentiate, you know, quite well against, I think it's relatively easy to show how we differentiate against… absolutely. Yeah… in terms of just in terms of how we generally work from a partnership kind of standpoint, we… work in referral. I mean, the partnership standpoint, you know, we try and be flexible to work with the partner. We're small enough as a company that we have got some flexibility in that. And I've got a reasonable amount of latitude for the partnership team. We work with many partners just in a sell with kind of engagement and, you know, what we well, and then we work with some partners in a referral kind of engagement where we're paying a referral fee. I'll tell you transparently with amp, we're working out, you know, a resale motion, amp, and these other consumption driven kind of products are a little bit different because they don't have the traditional software margins that sane and atlassian does. And so the referral margins are different and frankly not as big as you would find in a traditional software product. And we're still kind of tinkering with that and finding that now, sort of complementing that from a partnership. Perspective. We're certainly able to provide… trial accounts and free credits and I'll talk about deal support in a second, but I have a gentleman working for me a partner solutions engineer who provides training and use case support and can support you in your usage of amp and in your positioning of amp. And we've got some more advanced resources for more advanced kind of use cases, you know, sort of, as business requires and sort of dictates, and these are forward deployed kind of engineers that can help with very specific kind of use cases. These are, you know, we generally pull them in when it's a very large kind of opportunity.\nSpeaker ...7161: I mean, we just call Steve basically, right? Ivan.\nSpeaker ...8537: Yeah, that's great. And you'll get not only will you get the answer but you'll get a very entertaining answer. So so that… that's you know, that's sort of the partnership organization. And then from the, you know, from the account standpoint, what we do is to pull in a direct, you know, a direct sales team and in this case, they would work through the partner. The idea there is that I would never want to have you competing with a, you know, with an account team at sourcegraph. And so, but there are many things that the account team knows and we'll be able to help you position.\nSpeaker ...7161: Maybe maybe two sentence to our partnership with atlassian.\nSpeaker ...7161: I don't know, if, you know, but it was recently changed to five percent discount, on selling licenses. Basically. So there is no, there is no 30 percent partnership uplift anymore there. So it's all co selling since a year already for us. So, we are one of the next gen partners of the new generation partners which are doing this from the beginning. We are co selling with atlassian in teams together at all accounts. So we have the big ones, right? You won't, sell a bosch or a deutsche bank without atlassian. And we are doing this co selling motion. So we are pretty much not looking after a standard after a standard cut of the license costs. We are really looking about adoption thing, co selling, 10 year relationship with the clients. We, we know bosch for 10 years. We know deutsche bank for four years. Now, we really want to stay long term in there and help from the inside. So you get the visibility in the inside and the time from the right people, and, we can get them further.\nSpeaker ...7161: And, we are living from the value we are generating there and not from license uplift. Basically just that, you know, how we see ourselves basically.\nSpeaker ...8537: That's great. That's actually very interesting. I didn't realize that, with atlassian, we've in, I've spent a lot of time at atlassian previously, but have not spent a lot of time on them. With them. In the last, you know, nine or nine or 12 months. We, well, they had a product called fisheye which was a code search product which we are kind of an adoption for. And then we spent some time with them, on rovo and other things. But they're turns out, their business is relatively different from ours. So I've spent less and less time with them but, I didn't know about the five percent thing that's interesting. I'll have to go go go read up on that.\nSpeaker ...7161: Pretty, pretty interesting motion. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...8537: And of course, you know, code search, you know, we index bitbucket which actually is where the fisheye stuff works of.\nSpeaker ...7161: course.\nSpeaker ...8537: So, I'm just looking at deutsche bank here. I see that we had talked to them back, in 20 23. So a couple of years ago now and that of course, would have been before we would have positioned amp in there. But so we have had some engagement. The rep, there is a Guy named, I believe is a Guy named James gaiety who sits in London. And I'm happy to set up a conversation with James. I think he would have the best actually and he has a very good solutions engineer who sits in London. They would have the best and I'm looking here, it says, they see 7,000 developers within deutsche bank that… they would have. I think, the best strategy in terms, of, you know, how to, you know, how to approach the account? Yeah, I'd love to sit on that call but I also want to be cognizant so.\nSpeaker ...7161: Do you see my screen? Yeah. So, we also have a page with all the stakeholders there. We can, we can share all the stakeholders with you also like what we have as contacts even, I see, the list is not up to date, right? Our, our last meetings, with the migration and devx teams are missing here. Maybe it's an edit mode. Let me see. No, they are not in here yet. So we need to update this quickly. Yeah, I think that's a good, that you say it's, this James Guy is interesting. I think we had him also in a call lately in the architecture board. We are currently also talking with them about the future of software development and about GitHub integration, into all the internal security processes like eim and stuff. So we might be in the same people already that's good.\nSpeaker ...8537: James is our Guy from.\nSpeaker ...7161: From your side. Okay. Yes. Yeah. So, so, yeah, let's but let's share, these people then let's see who we talk to on deutsche bank side and stuff. Ivan. We need to update this list here, right? Yeah. And look at it together. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...7733: Tom, could you spell the last name of James?\nSpeaker ...7161: But that's the amp Guy, right? Yeah.\nSpeaker ...8537: Yes, his last name, is guyetti which is spelled GH a EIDI.\nSpeaker ...7733: Okay.\nSpeaker ...8537: I'll talk to James today and make him make an introduction either today or tomorrow all.\nSpeaker ...7733: Right. All.\nSpeaker ...8537: Right now, I do think, I mean test, is a good use case is a good foot in the door.\nSpeaker ...8537: You know, we see a lot of people that actually, you see a lot of people that use amp initially for documentation, explain this code to me, build test cases for this code, etc, because to your point, they may not want to make direct changes to that, but there are lots of ancillary things as part of the stlc that need to be taken care of which amp can be quite, you know, quite effective at. So, I think that's, a worthy entry point. I suspect that James and his team will have, you know, some other ideas as well. Yeah. Now, are you all set up on amp? Do you all have amp accounts yourselves? Yep. Wonderful. Okay, good. Are there other accounts that we should see if we can get aligned on?\nSpeaker ...7161: Definitely, in the future, but it's, we are so much happening at the same time at the moment. So, we will reach out after we had the first workshop, I think, but we definitely will use it for the workshop and.\nSpeaker ...8537: When, when is your first workshop?\nSpeaker ...7161: So the, no, not planned yet, but, I got the commitment yesterday. So, so let's see. I will keep you updated. We will basically, we can share the, what customers do we do workshops with amp? And then we can go into motion together. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...8537: Very good. I imagine that you will need, we'll need to make sure that you got appropriate credits, for the workshops and then have you done an NDA with anyone?\nSpeaker ...7161: From you guys? No, no, okay.\nSpeaker ...8537: Okay. All right. Well, let me, I'll send you an NDA as well. I'll do that separately from my instruction to James.\nSpeaker ...7161: Makes sense. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...8537: And then what other AI tools are you all working with?\nSpeaker ...7161: Cloud code? Obviously, everything, which, what is out there? Basically, okay.\nSpeaker ...8537: All.\nSpeaker ...7161: of them, all of them, we have licensed all of them, I'm.\nSpeaker ...7733: at least using four.\nSpeaker ...7161: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...7733: Actively. So codecs, gemini cli, cloud code and robo, right? And, and are you?\nSpeaker ...8537: Comfortable with amp in terms of its features and functions and differentiation? It would be useful to have a kind of deeper session on that.\nSpeaker ...7161: I'm comfortable having the stand up, in discord and joining there from time to time. So we discord is great. We are getting a lot of input there. But Ivan, go ahead. I'm not the full time coder.\nSpeaker ...7733: Following this car? Like like I, so from the sales point of view, I currently do not see much difference between those tools, right? So if you would like to go into differentiation and actually saying where amp shines. I remember, I think Steve posted on LinkedIn recently, there was comparison of the pull request acceptance between the tools and amp was on top. It was like a post from this week or last week, like, you know, to really get the point, why would they, like? I already have gemini cli, right? So why would I pay for them? Like on a deutsche bank level, right? But when I have like 7,000 developers each developer spend, I know, 100 bucks per month that's a lot of money. So the question is, why would I do that? And this is something which would be really interesting to understand. Definitely.\nSpeaker ...7161: Play through some questions, basically, right? We have our view on the thing, we have our argumentation, right? Why it's better. But sharing that, and talking about that is always helpful. I guess, yeah, right.\nSpeaker ...8537: Okay. Yeah. I mean, for gemini, we actually see quite a bit of results kind of differentiation. You know, we believe that is I'm sure, Steve. Well, actually, you may or may not know, we rely on the cloud models relatively heavily, but we do use chat gpt for the oracle and we use, I believe, for summarizing effectively based upon the task, we are going to a purpose built, you know, we're going to a model where we believe that, the performance and results, are the best. And actually for all of those things, it's pretty obvious now. And so that, you know, is all resulting in, you know, a higher level, of results that we're that we are generating now. Of course mileage varies on that, in some places that resonates incredibly well and people say, you know, there's no comparison in other places. They say, you know, it's it seems to be, it seems to be closer there then is, you know, just, a user experience. And so how people like how, the features, are integrated and that's largely up to, you know, the taste of the developers and how well we work within the standardized kind of development environments, that they have. And then more strategically, I will say, with some buyers and this is not with all buyers but some buyers are uncomfortable working with a tool from a model shop given that the rate of change within the model shops. And so, I mean, I'm just you're talking about cloud code. You know, I think that it's hard to argue that flood codes is not the most effective solution from the model shops right now. But who knows, given this market, do they get leapfrogged? And so sourcegraph is in a unique position that we do have the ability to change the models that we work with relatively easily. And we're always testing as new versions of models come out or new areas of functionality and are able to incorporate them quickly. Where if you are, you know, let's say if you're all in, on gemini and who knows, I mean, everybody's always saying that, you know, Google's next thing is, can be amazing. Maybe it is, I'm the people that are stuck on, you know, maybe some people are standing on cloud code, who knows, but many people like, the positioning of sourcegraph housing the market not is a model house perhaps?\nSpeaker ...7733: Pardon.\nSpeaker ...7161: Sorry, pitch.\nSpeaker ...7733: Deck pitch deck, do you have one like to have all the points like as a powerpoint slide or something? Is there something which summarizes this differentiation already?\nSpeaker ...8537: Oh, I actually can't think, of a slide right now but I'm sure that we have, I'm sure that within the field there are many. So, let me see what I can find. Okay. So, okay. So I will talk to James today or tomorrow. I will make an introduction there. I will get you an MN… NDA so, we can speak, you know, openly appreciate your openness, you know, so so far here. And then I'll get you a few more ideas, on use cases and competitive differentiation. Either James or I will.\nSpeaker ...7161: Awesome. Please please.\nSpeaker ...8537: Keep us posted on, you know, if you're preparing for workshops and make sure that we well do whatever is appropriate, you know, one, making sure that you've got credits and then that you get the materials that you need. And then we're we are of course happy to support those workshops however, is appropriate given how they're set up sounds?\nSpeaker ...7161: Like a plan. Awesome. Cool. All.\nSpeaker ...8537: Right, gentlemen.\nSpeaker ...7161: Thanks a lot for the initial talk that's amazing. It's it's good to see all the movement in the, in this area really exciting times and talk to you soon. It's.\nSpeaker ...8537: it's super exciting times, crazy how fast it's all moving. So, I like, your approach. You guys should be a I'm looking forward to building a partnership with you all because, you know, it, the intersection of sdlc… and AI is a very interesting place for us to be. And frankly, I mean, I told you the outro guys, this is, I think a very strategic place to be because yes, going and adopting this in a meaningful way across your sdlc is a very different. It's a very different question than how do you go vibe code? So I think there's a lot of business but of course, a huge amount of return there. So, correct?\nSpeaker ...7161: Yeah, that's where we see our future in consulting and we will still do some sdlc stuff and some CI CD stuff, in implementing this, but it's completely different in the future. I.\nSpeaker ...8537: Think. Yeah, yeah, agreed. Agreed. All right. Very good. Awesome. Thanks for the time.\nSpeaker ...7161: Thank you so much. Talk to you soon. Bye bye.",

Good?\nSpeaker ...6419: How are you?\nSpeaker ...4620: Good as well.\nSpeaker ...6419: Amazing. Nice to see you again. How's your month of September been?\nSpeaker ...4620: Not too bad. How are you?\nSpeaker ...6419: Good. I'm good. Thanks for setting aside some time today just to give some context. I know previously on the account, I've been on the account since February and there's been limited strategy conversations or live engagement touches. I figured it might make sense to me today if that's something you think would be helpful to continue on a monthly basis or even quarterly. I'm happy to support that. But yeah, I would love to hear from you if you find live updates or partnering closer is helpful based on your sourcegraph subscription or how you streamline things today.\nSpeaker ...4620: Yeah. So I mean, firstly… thank you for setting this up. It's always good to have conversations around what we could do differently in the partnership and obviously leverage the licenses that we are paying for. There's. Been sort of an interesting trend for us internally at atlassian. So, in a sense, what I see is at the moment, we are both from a strategic perspective as well as from really on the ground usage perspective, seeing a lot more traction in our internal products and our internal tools. And this is reflective of why as an example, we are seeing the usage taper off or at least flatten for sourcegraph. And I see that trend continuing at least in the near term. Now, things can always change and there can always be nuances to what I'm saying. But in general, that's where we are at. And so I think fundamentally a world where I would see rapid uptick in our usage… of sourcegraph in the short term. At least I don't see it. So just wanted to call that out. So we are clear on where things are from our perspective. Yeah. So let me pause there and get your feedback on this, yeah.\nSpeaker ...6419: No, that's really helpful. I think just in this industry, obviously, things move so quick and I think it's exciting that you guys are building things in house that your developers prefer. I think if anything, we rather our customers have a strong internal workflow and we want everyone to be successful.\nSpeaker ...6419: So I totally hear you and happy to kind of just continue to keep an eye on things. I think what I could do going forward is always happy to send any product updates your way. And if any sound interesting, we could always hop on the line or talk about it if there's any like red flags or really exciting moments. I think something really relevant that we just rolled out that. I think one of the main reasons I wanted to chat today was really relative based on if you continue seeing developers use tools internally is that we just actually rolled out a sourcegraph MCP server. So this will allow you to connect AI agents and applications to your sourcegraph code search. And this is in version six point eight. So you would just have to, you know, align with that version. But this feature is currently available as experimental. So it has no additional cost today. But again like seeing how customers work with it to determine PMP. But I've seen a lot of customers really excited about this when they're building things in house because they can still leverage the impact of your index code search.\nSpeaker ...4620: Yeah, that's a great point. I will run that by the team. So you said we need to be on version six point eight and above. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...6419: And I'm saying that, but you guys are on six point eight, so you're good to go and I can send documentation. Do you prefer email or is it easier to slack? Like, is it easier to message you in a different way?\nSpeaker ...4620: Slack is generally what we use, but email is fine as well. Are you on atlassian slack or like do we need to add you as a?\nSpeaker ...6419: I should be. So I've worked with, oh, I think I see you. I'm trying to just, I've worked with other contacts via slack at atlassian. But I'm not sure if I'm a part of like your guys' ecosystem in slack?\nSpeaker ...4620: Oh, no.\nSpeaker ...6419: But I can see if I could bring you up here. You might not come up on mine. Yeah. Are you part of the support channel by chance for atlassian?\nSpeaker ...4620: No. Okay. That's fine. We could stick with email. I think that's totally okay. Okay. Perfect. Yeah, like send me the latest documentation and whatnot.\nSpeaker ...4620: And I will, I'm sure there will be some interest. A lot of people have been asking for apis and whatnot, which again have pros and cons. So I think an MCP here would certainly help.\nSpeaker ...6419: Okay, perfect. When you see kind of users moving towards other tools internally at atlassian, are they other code search tools or like what other tools have been kind of like moving dev usage towards? Yeah.\nSpeaker ...4620: So this is primarily more, this is not necessarily something that we have as part of our product portfolio, but in essence, we've built our own code… search for our engineers at atlassian. So this is in essence our internal tooling.\nSpeaker ...6419: Okay. Cool. Okay. That's exciting. Okay. Amazing. Well, yeah, love. Any feedback on the MCP or if any questions come up. I think something else that we spoke about on site was deep search and that is, you know, a complimentary product as well to search and it's definitely like unique to sourcegraph or at least I haven't seen many other people have like similar solutions to it. So, I mean,\nSpeaker ...4620: that was one that Tarun was excited about. Like when we met, we also talked to you about what we're doing with robodev and whatnot, right? So, in general, that… area is something that we'd certainly want to explore. Do you have like becoming part of your product offering right now? Or where is deep search at currently?\nSpeaker ...6419: It's currently within the search UI. So it's a part of sourcegraph. Traditionally, I know we spoke about another AI agentic tool called amp. Oh.\nSpeaker ...4620: Amp is the one that's the additionalizing. But deep search is already part of it. Okay.\nSpeaker ...6419: Yeah, deep search is already available. Let me just actually just for… might as well just show you quickly. I won't do like a demo. I know we already did but just to get kind of an idea of sure. So this is, you know, the sourcegraph UI and then it would be just like code search on the toggle bar on the top left. We have a deep search toggle. What I wanted to bring up today was this was research preview when we met beginning of September. Now this is officially moved to GA. And with that starting October, we're actually putting free allocation deep search queries on each of our customers' accounts. And it's based on the way your license is set up. And then from there, you could like purchase more deep search queries. The positive part is we're not seeing many customers like hit their deep search allotment. But since atlassian is discounted in such a degree, you guys have such a great rate. Currently, you actually aren't set up for any deep search queries that are free. But I raised my hand because I know this is like something we spoke about. So would love for you to kind of think about it over the next week or so. As this becomes officially like rolling out on October fifteenth, we are open to giving atlassian some free deep search queries to test it out if you would like with a specific like power user cohort, and I can give you some enablement like in a developer guide that I put together a PDF, one pager. I can send that via email, but I figured I want to still give you guys the opportunity to try it, see if there's impact and if so, we could talk about options?\nSpeaker ...4620: Yeah. So that's a great idea… because you said it's in preview. Is it already enabled for our users currently at atlassian? Do, you know?\nSpeaker ...6419: Let me check. You do have to turn it on. That is something that you need to do. And then also you would need to sign an AI addendum because you are technically using llms within that solution… that's kind of the steps of if people that have like our AI products are able to just turn it on because they already have signed like language around the llms. But that's kind of where atlassian would sit. So I'm happy to send the addendum just so you have it even if you're not interested, but it's just the first step of it.\nSpeaker ...4620: Please do, please, do I'll socialize that internally? I'd love for us to at least as you said, test it out, see where the value is. And if there is, then we can figure out what else we do on the licensing aspects. But, yeah, that's a good call out.\nSpeaker ...6419: Okay. Amazing. Yeah, if you want to just look at everything and then kind of give me the green light when, and if you're ready to move forward to test that complimentary, obviously. And then also if you have kind of some estimate of certain number of maybe power users that you want to enable this for, that will allow us to also think. Okay, like what makes sense with that free allotment?\nSpeaker ...4620: Makes sense. Yeah, sounds good.\nSpeaker ...6419: Cool. Okay, perfect. Alrighty. Those were the two main items that I had today. I think also you guys when we met mentioned migrations. And again, another part of your contract today is you have the tool batch changes, which just helps with large migrations. That is like a fancy find and replace tool. We're seeing about like 10 to 25 monthly users using that atlassian. But if there are major migrations happening, I just, I think it's worth highlighting. I can also send you information. Are you looped in on that product at all batch changes?\nSpeaker ...4620: Yes, partially. But if you could send me some data, there are a couple of teams that work quite extensively on migration. So I'm happy to send it to them and actually ask them to see if the solution works for them.\nSpeaker ...6419: Okay, perfect. Yeah. And this is one of those legacy products that again is like a part of code search. There's no specialization with that with research preview or anything. And we did a lot of product enhancements to it in the last six months. So excited to see if I'm happy to meet with that team as well. If they do have questions or want like a formalized training around it sounds.\nSpeaker ...4620: Good.\nSpeaker ...6419: Okay. Amazing. Okay. Those were my three main items. So anything else top of mind for you?\nSpeaker ...4620: Yeah, no, I think this is good. The one big one which I think we should certainly discuss is deep search and see how that goes. But I'm also excited about the MCP aspect.\nSpeaker ...4620: So let's figure that out. Yeah, the migrations one we can take it offline outside of that. I think for the moment, we have not sort of… when are we up for renewal? This is likely in March, right? If I recall.\nSpeaker ...6419: Yeah, I think you're 100 percent correct? Yeah, March thirtieth.\nSpeaker ...4620: Okay. So let's maybe either towards the end of this year or early Jan start having conversations on what that looks like and what would the next steps be there?\nSpeaker ...6419: Okay, perfect. Yeah, that sounds great. Let me just actually know in my calendar here we could, I'll just make sure to reach out maybe mid November even to start conversations early. That's about a little under 150 days out. If that works for you. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...4620: Let's do it. Okay?\nSpeaker ...6419: Perfect. Okay. Wonderful. Perfect. Well, really appreciate the time and yeah, we'll send those resources today by end of day. So you have those in hand?\nSpeaker ...4620: Awesome. Thank you so much.\nSpeaker ...6419: Okay. Thank you. Happy Friday.\nSpeaker ...4620: Thank you. Bye.",

What do you want? Sorry?\nSpeaker ...3201: I had a moment there where it was just difficult connecting to the zoom but glad we're connected here.\nSpeaker ...8220: How's everything?\nSpeaker ...3201: It's good. It's a Friday, yeah.\nSpeaker ...8220: Happy Friday.\nSpeaker ...3201: Your pleasure being my first call today. So excited for that. Just getting ready. I think family's going out to dinner tonight all, you know, fun things. So just stuff like that. What about you?\nSpeaker ...8220: Yeah, same at the end of my day today, it's seven P. M. So I'm taking this. This is my last meeting for today and I should just start enjoying my weekend.\nSpeaker ...3201: Oh, absolutely. Well, thank you for staying on late if it is any solace to you. Like we can always end a few minutes early if that would help. But I definitely am grateful that you're taking the time later on a Friday to reconnect, I guess to jump right into it. Then my colleague Carter had pulled me aside and he mentioned that the two of you had connected last year about some just code AI initiatives that you folks have at cme. It sounded like there was interest in the time potentially about evaluating Cody and that there were some competing initiatives across the organization for you. And some folks at cme in particular, definitely wanted to give you a look at what we've updated since then with amp. I don't know if you're privy to amp or if you've heard of it or if Carter shared any of that context with you, but I'm happy to, regardless. I did want to take a step back and just, you know, fill in the gaps, hear what's happened for you individually. And then for the cme organization since then it's definitely something it's an exciting time to be working in software to be using AI tools to be thinking about how to apply those tools to your organization. And, you know, I'm not a developer by trade, but I've now been in the software industry for four or five years and it's been fun up leveling and learning about it myself and then coming alongside engineering leaders such as yourself and thinking about how to up level your engineering team. So anyway, that's enough for me but I'd love to hear a little bit more on what you're working on and kind of the gap since we last connected.\nSpeaker ...8220: Yeah. So first, nice to meet you. So by the time we did the meeting a year ago, we were doing an evaluation for one of the projects that you're working on.\nSpeaker ...8220: So why we chose sourcegraph at that time is that we wanted a tool that would access several microservices at a time. And we did some research and we found that sourcegraph might be a potential for us. And by that time, we had to switch priorities from the business. So they said that we can leave this project for a moment. And I replied back to Carter at that time that we want to switch priorities. So the management is not interested in this project anymore. I mean, the project that we were working on. So we switched priorities, but I would like to hear from you currently, what we are working on to see the added value from your side. So I can discuss it further with the upper management. So the issue that we were facing one year ago. Now, I think it's resolved. So for example, we're using codex, we're using GitHub, copilot, we're using cursor. So for example, for codex, I can simply create a new repo and I can grab all the different microservices, the folders inside this repo, and codex can have access to the whole repo and it can do analysis. It can answer all the questions for me, the same for the GitHub copilot. So I would like to hear from you. What are the added values in this case for the amp tool?\nSpeaker ...3201: Wonderful. Yeah. So what I can do is briefly share my screen and show a little bit of that information for you Mohamed. I guess what would be super interesting to hear in terms of? And I don't have differentiators with codex pulled up here. But what you're seeing are just some basic differentiators between cursor and cloud code and amp, as they apply to agentic use cases or which audiences are optimized for each of these tools and how they're accessed and how you can collaborate. I'd be curious to know just from your end between those tools and the initiatives that you're either working on now or that you are reentertaining now following last year, like which of these tools do you enjoy the most? Where do you see any gaps? And what do you see is needing to be improved?\nSpeaker ...8220: Yeah, it's a good question. So I tried both cursor and cloud code. So if you want cursor versus codex, I would go with codex because I think it has first, it's a better user experience because I would like to see everything inside the browser. I can ask codex to do several tasks in parallel and it can then reply back to me after a certain amount of time sending me the pull request. I can simply review them. It will create the branch for me and all this stuff. Either I merge or I ask codex to do another changes. So between cursor and codex, I would choose codex for cloud code. I think the added value of it is that it's a full agent. So you can simply run the agents from the command line on windows. So I think it's an added value regarding that. So I think if I want to work, it would be a mix between codex and cloud code because in this case, I can simply run the agents on my machine on my desktop. Let's say I'm using windows, I can do whatever I want, can integrate it with MCP agents. And for the changes from the code perspective, I would go with codex and ask codex to do whatever it want… for GitHub. Copilot. The added value of GitHub copilot is that I have the ability to switch the models. So I can either go to cloud, I can use cloud or I can use codex or I can use… gemini. So this is an added value for GitHub copilot. So basically we're working with all of this stuff, but I was interested to see in this case what would be the added value of using amp?\nSpeaker ...3201: Yep. One quick call out as you can see, and as you're diving into these different tools, I think every provider is taking a different approach as to how do we tackle AI coding assistance? What is going to optimize for quality and value for our end users? You're talking about how codex you can operate more agentically in parallel in the background maybe than cursor and cloud code being available in cli or using MCP agents with codex. So I think that number one, I think it would be good for me to kind of start at the top in terms of what is our strategy with amp, how is amp, different than strategies we've taken in the past? Where are we now? And what might make sense for you folks to do in the future? I guess as a call out after this, we'd be happy to schedule a more customized demo for some of your end developers to see and set you guys up on a trial. Should that make sense? But I want to make sure that I give you some ground to stand on here and we can kind of learn together. I think a good place to start to set the context is since November of 20 22. With the kind of chat gpt moment. We've been applying AI to the software development cycle. I don't need to say this to, you know, this and I think it started with some really fun autocomplete functionalities, rag based chat bots. So moving from your basic, you know, starting day copilot, going into tools like Kodi, where you could access more contextually aware AI coding assistance. Then came the VS code forks whether it be cursor and windsurf. And those have continued to progress in terms of how they're agentically applied to the code base. And now what I'm hearing more so, and I think you could apply codex into this latter category of full agentic tools being amp, cloud code, codex, being able to autonomously look throughout your code base and really push something up here all the way to remediation, right? This leads into what makes amp, different, feel free to read some of these points at your leisure. But what I would call out as it pertains to what you're you were calling out, amp, is going to be available anywhere your developers are working anywhere you're working. So whether that be VS code, jetbrain, cli, amp, is going to have an interactive mode for all of those. We're going to meet you where you're working out of one key differentiator is that you mentioned with copilot, being able to switch different models is really helpful because with codex, obviously you're going to be locked into open AI models and with cloud code, you're going to be locked into anthropic models. And what we've seen being more so having a research lab mentality is that for some of like gpt five, we found very helpful for deep reasoning use cases and understanding the code base and being thoughtful and working through unit tests. Whereas the sonnet models tend to be very proactive and quick and thorough in generating code more quickly. And so, we've taken a step back and have taken a similar stance to copilot in that, okay, the happy medium here seems to be allowing for model agnosticism and for using different models for different use cases, which I think is the right approach where we take a differentiated approach from copilot is that we think switching between models is too much cognitive overhead for you and your cme developers to be undertaking. What do I mean? Similar to how gpt five may be better at deep reasoning. But sonnet four point five is better for generating code. Some of your developers may not know that or may not have the time to study that or to up level on that. And you don't want people switching between different models and getting different outputs and not adhering to best practices for your particular development practices. So what we do is we do the research on the front end and align those different models to the different workflows that your developers are enacting. So when you're working within amp, there is not going to be a model drop down. What you can be guaranteed is you're going to be working with frontier models for a given use case.\nSpeaker ...3201: And we're not cutting corners with that. We're providing whatever model we believe to be the premier model into that workflow for you and your developers that's one. And I want your response to this in a moment. But that dovetails with the second aspect in that unlike traditional sas based tools, we are not pricing amp on a per user per month flat subscription based fee. This is going to be purely usage based. So we're optimizing for outcomes here. We're not requiring you and your team to do a big upfront commitment for an entire year across your entire development force. This can be something where you start with, you know, 5,000 dollars of credits or more and your team can burn those credits down over time, ensuring that you're going to have access to the best models for a given use case and that, you know, there aren't going to be constraints. Towards the end of the month or whatever, we're going to a cheaper model. So that's where when you think of amp as it stands between your codexes and cursors and copilots of the world, amp is going to be your premium AI coding assistant, that is usage based paired with the best models and it's optimized for quality. We definitely are taking a differentiated approach and would want to hear kind of your immediate take on that. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...8220: I want to explanation regarding how it will choose the model behind the scenes. So based on the use case based on the question, it will change the model behind the scenes or how is it going in this case?\nSpeaker ...3201: Yes. In terms of like how we do that, that's something that we're pre configuring based on. Like for instance, if I go up here and select all the different like use cases that amp is conducting on behalf of our customer base, we have already pre configured amp to where, you know, if you're generating a unit test, or if you're trying to understand the code base, you're generating an agent dot MD file or you're updating legacy code, we have done the research on our hand to know which model is going to be best for that workflow. And then as a default model, if there are use cases that we haven't thought of, it is going to default to cloudsonic at four point five. So that is how we've configured amp?\nSpeaker ...8220: OK, gotcha. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3201: Cool. That being said, I did want to ask, I know we had this from our last interaction, but know that you folks are working within GitHub and gitlab, primary repo. It sounds like is gitlab number one. Is that still true? And number two, are you folks, you mentioned you like working within cli? Would you say that's common throughout cme or other folks like using their editors or how does that look for your team?\nSpeaker ...8220: No, it's you can think, you can say that each one has his own perspective. So some guys would like the cli, some guys would like using this code. Some guys would like to use directly the agent on the browser. So it's up to each one. So from my perspective, I'd like to use always to use codecs because it has a better user experience and better flexibility. Sometimes I need to do and I usually do it for let's say I'm doing a research for about certain stuff or I want reasoning. So I use it, I use gpt five sometimes for quick implementations. Let's say I'm updating a file. I can go and use GitHub copilot. And I can simply change the model based on the use case that I have.\nSpeaker ...3201: Okay. Wonderful. In terms of security requirements. Is this a situation where your organization has really dove in headfirst trying to apply these tool sets? Are there any types of like table state requirements in terms of soc two or zero data retention that's important for your team?\nSpeaker ...8220: Yeah, it's very important for us. So basically all the tools that we are using are enterprise tools because security is very important for us. And I think based on the meeting that we did a year ago, it seems you have, we talked about the enterprise version, right? Yes, where we can have everything deployed on a machine dedicated for us on azure, right?\nSpeaker ...3201: So Cody at that time did offer that. So what I did want to go ahead and get to the front of here with amp is, amp would be a multi tenant solution.\nSpeaker ...8220: And where it will be deployed?\nSpeaker ...3201: It will be deployed. I have my security reference pulled up here, so hopefully you can still see my screen. So it would be GCP.\nSpeaker ...8220: Okay. On your GCP account? Yes. Okay. This is a concern for us. Yeah, this is a red flag actually. Okay.\nSpeaker ...3201: Okay. And if I could ask you why is that just because in terms of AI tooling, you folks would want to have everything in house or what does that look like?\nSpeaker ...8220: For, yeah, we prefer that because we have some code that would be, we don't want, we want it always to be private. We don't want anyone to have access on the code. So that's why? Yep.\nSpeaker ...3201: I will call out. I don't know if this would remediate that concern. It is something that tends to help with our other customers, but we do guarantee zero data retention for any inputs and outputs. So that helps, we have soc two type two compliance. Yeah, like I called out, we're not going to be able to deploy this fully on premise.\nSpeaker ...8220: Okay, cool. Okay, gracias.\nSpeaker ...3201: Wonderful. So I guess follow up question to that, I can send this security reference your way along with our terms if that'd be helpful for your team to review. But I guess starting at the end in mind here, is that going to be a non starter for your group or is this still something that we could consider?\nSpeaker ...8220: I think, we need some time. So so on the time being, we don't have any use case that we think that we might require a new tool other than the tools that we are currently use. So, we have cursor, we have GitHub, copilot, we have codecs. So for now, I think we're good. But in case we found something that will not be solved using these tools, then in the case, I would go and send email back to you to see if we have anything that might be solved from your side.\nSpeaker ...3201: Yeah, absolutely. So no, we can stay in touch asynchronously about that. And so I can set a note on my end to follow up with you just as we have some new updates and we're offering new things forward looking with that in mind because it sounds like maybe right now it's not the best time to re, reconnect on this exactly?\nSpeaker ...3201: Are there things that you would anticipate like, hey, it would be really helpful if our agents could do this or this is a certain pain that our developers are working through right now or are you guys in a standpoint where it, you know, between cursor and codecs, really, things seem to be working well.\nSpeaker ...8220: I think for the time being between cursor codecs and GitHub copilot or everything is working well, so I would like to hear back from you in case you had some, something that would be an… added value or an issue that would be solved… through your tool. So, in case you implemented or added a new feature that would be an added value that we cannot achieve through codecs or cursor or GitHub copilot, then in this case, I would like to hear back from you because in this case, it would be interesting for the management, for the upper management. Because if I want to talk about this for the upper management, they're going to say, what are the added value? In this case? Since we're using these, we're paying money for all these three tools. So we have, we are about like 500 employees employee. So we're paying the enterprise version for both codecs cursor and GitHub copilot. So if there is an added value that does not exist in these tools and we found that might be used by us and it will speed things up for us. Then in this case, reply back to me and I can mention it for the upper management to see if they are okay with it.\nSpeaker ...3201: Yeah. And that in mind, similar to what we talked about, I'll definitely follow up, just overviewing a few of those differentiators I mentioned being we were not locked into a certain model family. We're going to meet your developers where they are removing the cognitive overhead of having to choose models so I can share some of those. Yeah. But what I acknowledge about those differentiators is, you know, it's easy for me to say that. And then it's one thing for developers actually to experience that and more of a subjective fashion where they're actually using it and seeing it head to head. And, you know, one thing that some of our early customers do is use amp as an extension like within cursor or use it in their cli and compare it to cloud code. And so one one offer that we do have that, you know, I don't know if this would be interesting right now or not. But we do offer trials in terms of offering one week access for you and your devs to try out. Amp, you know, as much as you'd like. So we can set that up in terms of seeing, hey, is this better? Are we seeing value gains from it? Is it adding additional value over the tools we already have? So that's something, I can send you details on what that would look like in terms of us setting that up… and go from there because I think our differentiators are best felt when your devs are in the product and comparing it head to head for a given use case, whether it be codecs or copilot. So that would be my recommendation but would want to take this at whatever pace you think would be most appropriate.\nSpeaker ...8220: Yeah. The thing here is that, we cannot use any trial version on our code. So for security reason, so in this case, I don't think this would work for us. The upper management will not accept that because security here can be tolerated from our side. So what I would go for, we can stay in touch. So if you have anything or any new features that have been added to amp, and you think that these, you can just send me these or these new features. And if I think that if I see that I'm interested in one of these and I found that these does not exist in the existing tools that we have, then I can reply back to you and I need to discuss it first with the management to see if they're okay with it.\nSpeaker ...3201: Yep, totally fair. Totally fair. Cool. So, mohammed, from here, I will send you that information particularly in what additional value amp does drive for our customers, particularly as it applies to security. And, and then I'll also send some documentation on how we're different from some of the tools you're already using. Yeah, if.\nSpeaker ...8220: It would be very helpful.\nSpeaker ...3201: Yeah. And then if it makes sense, to reconnect to set up a trial, happy to do.\nSpeaker ...8220: So, yeah, thanks, man. And nice to meet you and have a good day.\nSpeaker ...3201: Yeah, happy Friday. Happy.\nSpeaker ...8220: Friday, man. See you see.\nSpeaker ...3201: You.",

Okay?\nSpeaker ...3326: Great. Sorry, my laptop microphone is acting up.\nSpeaker ...3200: Oh, that's all good. Don't worry. Well, yeah, I'll just quickly introduce myself. My name is isuru I'm based out of Sydney, Australia. I'm a field engineer working on the amp team. So at the moment, my team, so the field engineers, we're focused on working with our customers on the most complex use cases, hacking around with new solutions and things like that. And right now we've picked a bunch of accounts and we look at the top token users within those accounts and we just want to understand your workflow, what you did, what you liked, what you didn't like, I had a look, I think like you used it. It's been a little while now, so maybe you were trialing it out, which is cool. So I wanted to hear your perspective on how that trial was. And then if you're interested, I have some things some newer features I can show you about like new SDK and some automation workflows and things. If you're interested, I can show you those things as well.\nSpeaker ...3326: Okay, great. Yeah. So I'm mitja, I'm here the lead backend engineer at outfit. And yeah, we've been trialing amp. So you guys put, I don't know one K, I think on our account for testing before we used, I mean, even now we use Kodi for a year or so and yeah, now we wanted to try more agentic approach and yeah, you guys gave us some credits. Yeah. So I've been using amp for, I don't know a few weeks. I think now we've run out of credits. So no more amp, unfortunately… but yeah, I've been, I used it for a few use cases. So.\nSpeaker ...3200: Yeah. So what type of use cases do you use it for?\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. Okay. So we do backend software development. So what I did was mixture of java and python. So I used it for, I had a couple of use cases. So one use case was, for example, I had to implement a simple feature… that was done already before in a similar way… and everything was well defined. There was exact definition of what the feature should look like, what it should do. And also most of the codes you could already reference on a previous one of the previous commits. So, yeah, I just gave the Jira, I mean, information from the Jira, and previous commits to amp with some instructions, what I expect also how to run the tests. And yeah, this was, this worked very well. This example.\nSpeaker ...3200: That's good. Yeah, a lot of people who use it like in the trial, especially like if they're coming from the Kodi style tooling, they don't know to like, oh, I gotta give it a reference to here's like something that worked, these are git commits use tooling, use the unit tests, and then amp can fix itself. So to hear that you used it that way is awesome. Yeah. Did, you, and you said you had a good experience using it that way?\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. That was, that was really good. It was fast. Well, fast. I don't know because I went to do other things in the meantime, but yeah, it liked, I only needed to the first prompt. Did it, the solution worked? The only thing that I needed to fix after was some documentation was a bit off or I wanted it's something written in a more specific way, but yeah, I think that manually. But I did my homework and I read the reference manual before. Also, I watched some YouTube videos. What's the best practice of using these agentic tools like cloud code. And so, yeah, this worked really well. This example. Nice.\nSpeaker ...3200: Sorry. Go on.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah, I have a few more or we can talk about this. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3200: Keep keep going. I'll I'm just taking some notes.\nSpeaker ...3326: Okay. So the next example was I was, so the previous one was java and gradle build systems. But the next one was python and uv build… system or package system, whatever. And that was implementing a completely new feature in like python mono repo. So create a new like slack bot basically. So yeah, we needed a slack bot which would receive a webhook parse… the webhook. The webhook actually was email sent from Sendgrid, and it had to parse it. And then based on what it parsed, it had to send it to a slack channel.\nSpeaker ...3200: Okay. So based on the response?\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. It was basically billing anomaly alerts. We have a cloud provider that we use and we get alerts about if we are spending too much. And unfortunately, this cloud provider supports only email alerts.\nSpeaker ...3200: Okay.\nSpeaker ...3326: So, we forward this email to Sendgrid, and Sendgrid, sends it via webhook, okay, to our API. But yeah, basically, it's it was a new service in a mono repo where there is bunch of other services. So I could give it reference how other services looks like and what I expect the slack message to look like, what to include. I also gave it the format of the email. I exported the email and in the eml format and I gave it as an example. And yeah, I wrote this and I also wrote that it should write some unit tests so it could get a feedback loop if stuff is working, right? So, yeah, again, yeah, so just.\nSpeaker ...3200: Just on that use case. So, if you, I guess like I'm keen to hear your perspective on how faster or smoother that process was or maybe it wasn't compared to, I guess how you would do it traditionally. So, I guess in your case, it'd be using Kodi. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. With, with Kodi, it's just, I would still write the majority of code myself probably, but then ask Kodi to implement maybe specific parts. But, yeah, it's to be honest from Kodi. I don't have such a good experience of like completely writing new stuff. I find it more useful of like adding some parts of the code or fixing some parts of the code.\nSpeaker ...3200: Like more tactful little changes rather than big.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. The big unit, it's hard to do it with Kodi because the context is narrower and yeah, you have to, you have to spend more time if you want to do this, I think, yeah.\nSpeaker ...3200: If you want to quantify it, so like if you want to do that same feature without, amp… how much longer do you think it would take?\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. So for example, this bot slack bot, the majority of time I would spend on parsing that email, you know? So I think I did this in like I think with amp, I did it in half a day with prompting like it was on and off, you know? So it took more days but effectively, I think it took half day of my work with amp, if I wouldn't if I would do it like manually, I would need, I know around two days I think to write this thing. So, so yeah, this was also, I needed a bit more with like previous like junior level feature because this was a completely new feature but it still saved me a lot of time and it brought unit tests and the documentation. I needed more prompts to get it. I mean, I needed to chat more but yeah, it's it was also, this was a very good experience.\nSpeaker ...3200: Oh, that's good. But what were there any things that you didn't like? Like, what was your, or any things that you felt that we should change in your opinion?\nSpeaker ...3326: That's a, good question. I mean, it's still not there for like more tasks where I didn't have good experience, for example, where something is going wrong or there is some error, you cannot find, you know, for example, we bumped a version of quarkus which is a java framework and the builds didn't work anymore. And, you know, since it was very new release of quarkus, AI… just couldn't figure out, you know, what was wrong? I spent a lot of time. I think I even spent 100 dollars on this, but yeah, like, yeah, just to debug complex issues. It's I felt like I spent more time with battling with amp than I would myself to dive deep.\nSpeaker ...3200: So you felt you could have, you could have just kind of gotten to that same conclusion faster with less tokens.\nSpeaker ...3326: Oh, I just gave up on the amp for this particular issue because I saw that I already spent a lot of money and I was getting nowhere. So, yeah, I just figured it out manually. So, for this like something is wrong, I don't know what the hell it is here are some logs and it just tries to guess but it, it's you know, it didn't solve it.\nSpeaker ...3200: Right. Funny. You say that because other people I've spoken to, they said that use case is where, it has saved them time. Obviously, it depends on the issue. Of course. So like that's a very loose thing. But where, like even in my own experience where it's like, oh, this has gone wrong. I don't know where this has introduced like where was this introduced? Yeah. I like, I find that amp, is actually really good to recursively look through git like you'll have like maybe like something in the log, it'll have like a clue of where that file was. And then I did have to instruct it to look through git history and then find root cause. Did you, did you try something like that by any chance?\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. Actually, I knew which version of the framework broke our build, but I wanted to find out why did it break our build?\nSpeaker ...3200: Oh, and that's what you're saying? There's no information. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. In the end, you know, I had to, in the end, I had to look into the source code of the framework and of quarkus and rebuild some manual rebuild with extra, debug logging and things like this to be able to figure out, you know, it would, I mean, yeah, I knew which version broke, but I still wanted to upgrade to this version with some work around, you know, I.\nSpeaker ...3200: See. Yeah. So you need to actually pull the code and understand it.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. Because there's not, you know, there's something in what they did. Some changes, broke it for us and yeah, I opened an issue for them and, oh,\nSpeaker ...3200: okay. So that level? Okay. So it's that level of issue? Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. Otherwise, if it's just an exception, you get, you know, this crashes, what could be wrong? Yeah, of course, it finds the issue pretty quickly especially if it can run the build or test to reproduce it that's very good. I just found that, you know, it's having the feedback loop with the tests and build that's like game changer, I think.\nSpeaker ...3200: Yeah, it is. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3200: It makes me glad to hear that you read the manual. It sounds like you did your own research and, you have an understanding of how to do that. It's yeah, it's yeah, you had like a good experience from the start. A lot of, a lot of my job is actually talking to people like you and they might be like, oh, but I didn't like tell it to run unit tests and then I'll have to tell them. So I feel like you're doing all of that stuff already, which is cool.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. Also the reference manual, it's not long. So, it's a, you know, it's a, you don't have to spend a lot of time to read it, which is nice. You know, there is no like bullshit inside.\nSpeaker ...3200: Yeah, they keep it very short almost too short sometimes, but I'm glad to hear it was, good for you, on your use case with the, where you had to pull down the source code. Do you know about like if you're in repo one and let's say you're using a framework in and you've pulled the source code down in repo two. Do you know about that feature where you can reference other repos by passing in the absolute part?\nSpeaker ...3326: Do you know about that? No, no, I didn't know that actually.\nSpeaker ...3200: Yeah. So let's say if we go through the problem you had before, so let's say, you know, you have, I forgot what it was called. Was it quark?\nSpeaker ...3326: Quarkus? Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3200: So, you have the repo for quarkus pulled in one thing and you have your application code and then you're saying, okay, we've upgraded to this framework. Something's gone wrong. I know the problem's in that framework here's, the absolute path for quarkus go through the revision history, try pinpoint the error, and then it could do some automation that way but you're still working in your source code, but it can look through the other one. You just need to reference the absolute path and it can jump other locations.\nSpeaker ...3326: Well, yeah, but that's on the local file system, right?\nSpeaker ...3200: It's gotta be local everything.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. Yeah. I'm just afraid here, you know, I would probably have to be very specific otherwise it could spend a fortune probably because that framework is really big. You know, you'd.\nSpeaker ...3200: want to definitely give it some guidance of like, hey, this is the area, things like that, cause it needs to like grab through it and find something. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah, yeah, because, yeah, I see the commands that it's running. And, yeah, it's like, amazing that, you know, that it's able to figure out such, grep, nice grep, commands and figure out stuff just from that. So, yeah.\nSpeaker ...3200: Yeah, cause I look at the syntax too, and I'm like, I had no idea like that's you could pull that stuff out. Like, so, it's a good way to learn as well. Do you, when you, so, when you're using these threads, like, you mentioned like one went to like 100 dollars. Do you know how much of the context window you used for that one? I don't know if you remember,\nSpeaker ...3326: I don't I even compact, I even know, I know if it's compacted or, yeah, I even compacted this thread a couple of times, I think, but I don't remember how much of it I used, but I never used more than 50 percent, you know? Okay, yeah, cool. And, you know, amp starts, starts warning you, I think even sooner, like if you spent like 20 percent or something, it starts saying, yeah, you should compact.\nSpeaker ...3200: Yeah. So, so in terms of like context management, and I guess cost reduction techniques, so anything above 200, like we have a 1,000,000 tokens per thread, anything above? I forgot the number exactly. Let's say it's like 250,000 in the 200 mark, the tokens, the credits cost a bit more because that's from our, inference providers, the rates go up. So, while you can use the full thread or even if it's up to 50 percent, that's fine to do as long as it's still giving you value. Now a technique you can use to get a lot more out of that thread. Let's say you want to use 20 percent of that main thread is you can use sub agents. Now, with sub agents, each sub agent has a 1,000,000 tokens, not that you would use all of them, but like let's say you're saying, go to this other code base, go check these things. You can just ask amp to go do that in sub agents, and we'll spawn multiple sub agents. Do these activities come back? And your main thread might be like two percent still or three percent?\nSpeaker ...3326: Whereas,\nSpeaker ...3200: normally would have been like 30 percent gone to do all of this stuff. It's a bit of a hidden feature in the sense that we don't want, amp, knows to use sub agents itself. But if you know the type of task you're going to do that, it could benefit from it, you just need to ask it to use sub agents.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah, I read about sub agents and I remember that, yeah, it uses sub agents automatically, but you can also use it. But then, yeah, I left this for like advanced use case. I didn't get to use it. So, yeah, but okay, that's good to know. So, I guess the agent has smaller context and doesn't bloat your existing context that way. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3200: Because you're using lots of smaller, yeah, lots of smaller sub agents and then you'll just get lots more and the performance is faster as well. Yeah, the experience all around is better. So.\nSpeaker ...3326: You're saying the more context you use, the more expensive it gets, right? Yes. So, if you,\nSpeaker ...3200: had a thread that cost you 100 dollars straight away, my head goes to like, oh, maybe you use a lot of that context window. And like if someone's having a bad experience, that's kind of what I've been seeing like, oh, I'm like trying to like figure out this thing or kind of stuck in a loop there's a concept where like the context is polluted, it's just like sometimes it's better to like declare bankruptcy on that thread. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3326: I do this actually. So it starts just, start fresh. Yeah, I also, yeah, yeah, I just start fresh, but I haven't gotten, you know, maybe I haven't gotten past 50 percent of context for sure. I think it was more like 30 percent I used or something like this.\nSpeaker ...3200: Right. Okay. You mentioned like when you were doing the webhook project, you know, you were doing that, you're kicking it off. You're test running all these things. What are you doing when that's going on? Like are you working on another task with another amp instance or like how, what's your workflow? Like.\nSpeaker ...3326: It really depends… this task that I spent 100 dollars on. I didn't leave it. I was like working on it all the time, the other tasks the first two I mentioned which were good. I would just leave it to do its work and do some other stuff in between. I would multitask in this example. I also.\nSpeaker ...3200: with amp, or like just.\nSpeaker ...3326: No, just do slack stuff slack and email and, yeah, meetings things like this. In any case, even without amp, I multitask too much. So, yeah, fair.\nSpeaker ...3200: Enough. Well, there is something I want to show you which is SDK… and I have a SDK plus 50 lines of code. And what I'm able to do is have three terminals and I have tickets in Jira, and I can kick off some of these tickets with amp. And these, in these 50 lines of code, it's able to progress the tickets along, create a, do you use git work trees by any chance? Do you know what that is?\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah, I know, but yeah, we are, we don't intellij shop. So, yeah, we don't intellij doesn't have a support for work trees. Yeah, we don't use them, but, I know what they are.\nSpeaker ...3200: Okay. But even at a git level, you can't use it with intellij.\nSpeaker ...3326: It's you would have to switch. You would have to open a separate project, you know?\nSpeaker ...3200: Oh, yeah.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. There you go. Because git work tree. As far as I understand, every branch is it's in own folder, right? Yes, that's right. Yeah. So, I checked this couple of years ago and intellij didn't have support, for this. I used neovin myself a lot for a bunch of stuff, but for java, it's not very good for python. I use it, but for java, it sucks. So, yeah, for that, I have to use intellij.\nSpeaker ...3200: Because, the thinking is like let's say you have, you know, 10 tasks to do. Five of them are medium, three of them are easy. Two of them are hard.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah, easy.\nSpeaker ...3200: Ones just chuck them into this thing I'm going to show you and then you just review the PR. So it's kind of like simple things that don't need like you want to make sure the code compiles unit tests are passing, but it's not like a big thing that's worthy of your time. You should just focus on making bigger tasks. Let me just quickly show you. And then you can tell me, okay?\nSpeaker ...3326: Of relevance.\nSpeaker ...3200: So what I'll do is I'll show you the code last actually. So I have these three tickets. I have this repo. This is just like a sample app that, I have it running. But for the purposes today, I won't show you and I have these three terminals here. And I'm calling in my example, this script execute agent that's just the name of my script and the ticket id in Jira. So can one can three, can four. So let me kick them up. You can see here. It's pulling the repository. It's creating a branch. It's starting a thread. And as you already would know, you can, I can let go and check on these threads on my phone and anywhere it's all on the internet. I can follow along. But really these are the type of tasks you don't want to be checking in at a thread level while it's working, you might come back to the thread after it's done. But let's have a look how this is going. So here, it's starting. Oops. Okay. So it's fetching the Jira ticket… created a work tree.\nSpeaker ...3326: Okay. This is your script, is doing this, right? Yeah creating work tree?\nSpeaker ...3200: I'll talk you through the script shortly. So it's updating the status to in progress. I've refreshed the page, some of these. Okay. So two of these are in progress. If I click into the ticket, it's you know, it's got whatever. I could add more information into this. Obviously give it some guidance. The thinking is that you break bigger things down into smaller things that are throwable into this unit of work. What I want you to take away from today isn't like my system. It's more that the flexibility of the SDK. This is just a common example that every developer kind of goes through and that I've only spent 50 lines of code to achieve this. So… maybe I'll just skip along. So if I click on one of these one that I've done earlier, once it's finished it'll, you know, put a description of what the changes are and say that it's tested and unit tests are passing a link to the pull request, a link to the amp thread because some of these things are like, I want you to go research on how to implement this. And then I want to check like, did you go to the right resources? Did you pull the documentation from the right thing? So here, this is a PR. So it's just adding a sort button, you know, something fairly simple in my agent's MD file. I have a pull request guidelines. So that's why this pull request is so high quality. Okay?\nSpeaker ...3326: Okay.\nSpeaker ...3200: That's not anything special to my thing, but it's more just the guidelines. But main thing is I can go and review the files. I could put comments in here. I can then with the thread id, I could go back to amp and continue with thread using that thread id. I can switch to that branch and then take over if I wanted to. But let me show you the code now, which is here. So the way this works is step one. I have to import the amp SDK. Of course, I have a hash map that maps my kanban board to the repo that I'm working in. So if you have multiple repos, you might want to manage it that way.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah, I'm sorry. Isuru can you just give me a minute? I need to change the meeting room? Sure. No problem. Just give me a minute.\nSpeaker ...3200: All good.\nSpeaker ...3326: Hey, sorry for that.\nSpeaker ...3200: That's all good. No problem.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. So you, yeah, yes.\nSpeaker ...3200: So, we resolved the repo, and then because this is running on my local machine, it has access to everything on my machine. So, for example, do you use GitHub by the way or?\nSpeaker ...3326: Something else? No, we're on bitbucket.\nSpeaker ...3200: Bitbucket. Yeah. So you could, yeah, I'm saying use the GitHub cli, but you could just say, you know, use the git, you know, the git operations, it'll use.\nSpeaker ...3326: The cli whatever. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3200: Exactly. So if you think of a use case that depends on an internal cli, you can just reference that. So this is doing all the heavy lifting. I'm not really managing any of the complexity amp's just moving tickets to in progress like this way. So fetch the Jira ticket. And I'm saying use the Jira tool. So I'll explain that in one second, but I'm just saying change the status to in progress, make, clone the repo, create a git work tree. I'm saying where to do it, create a branch, start working the solution like whatever your requirements are for your simple units, you just customize that to what you need. And then you can start pushing work through that. And with the execute method… all I'm doing is it's going to stream out responses based on the message type. So if it's a system message, but once it's all done, you'll see a result message type, and then, you know, the execution's completed, either it failed or it's successful. So really, you can build a lot of use cases off this SDK. This is just one example. We have other teams who are exploring, like when there's an on call issue, they will first pass it through a system like this that they've built on top of the amp SDK which will pull context from the observability platform, look through git, come up with like just an opinion on where to start investigating. So things like that is how it works before I go on and show you the toolbox tool. Any questions so far?\nSpeaker ...3326: No, no. I am interested about the Jira integration. Okay?\nSpeaker ...3200: Is your Jira self hosted or it's not? No.\nSpeaker ...3326: We use cloud Jira, okay. So cloud bitbucket. Okay.\nSpeaker ...3200: Great. So you could use the MCP server for atlassian if you wanted to. But there is an annoying thing with the oauth, it just keeps popping up. So for some of these kind of work, you would have probably experienced that it's like it keeps making you authenticate. I don't know of a way that you can bypass that with API keys. But this is a good way solution to put into the amp toolbox. So what the amp toolbox is? I've said toolbox, I've said a path and this is a toolbox here. And I have a Jira tool and this Jira tool.\nSpeaker ...3326: We have.\nSpeaker ...3200: Two things that the Jira sorry, a amp toolbox tool needs to do which is describe itself. So what can it do? So, these are the actions it can do. And then when we execute that tool, what does it do? And in this case, I can get a Jira ticket, update the status, add a comment and it's just using the standard API for that. So we have lots of customers who don't want to use the community MCP servers that are out open source, put the API keys into that. So this is a great way to avoid doing that. So I have all this code that I can share with you if that's something you want to look at. And yeah, so this is just 50 lines of code 48. If you don't need to use the Jira tool, it'll just be this, but you might think of this is just an example. So you'll think of better use cases that are realistic to your workflow, that may be helpful.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah, I know this is pretty simple. 50 lines of code is nothing.\nSpeaker ...3200: Like a third of it's probably the prompt as well.\nSpeaker ...3326: This SDK.\nSpeaker ...3200: is probably like two weeks old, maybe. So, it's something fairly new for us but we're seeing like this is, yeah… this is quite a powerful feature if it's the right people use it and understand what it can do, which is kind of the problem I'm trying to solve which is making sure people can see what it's capable of and just give them some examples to work with.\nSpeaker ...3326: I guess you have to have first the project ready for this with good agent MD, yes, and well defined jiras and very small jiras probably.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah, it's worth… trying.\nSpeaker ...3200: In the sense that like if you have a Jira ticket and you might, I don't know if you have subtasks, you can break down a subtask or a bigger ticket and put that subtask in… or it may be too big. And this isn't the use case for you like that's. I'm not saying it needs to be Jira, but the trend… that we're seeing like as a field engineer is people's jobs are transforming in that a lot of their effort is going from just breaking down big complex things into smaller things. And when they're small enough, the efficiencies are just putting that into some other system and focusing on these big complex things.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah, I know it's even if human is writing code, you know, I know that if you define smaller tasks, you know, like you said, the project goes faster so that's right? Yeah. But yeah, usually people are too lazy to break it down into small enough things. And because opening Jira is hard.\nSpeaker ...3200: That's true.\nSpeaker ...3326: So, yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker ...3200: You'll be surprised in that if the work becomes easier if you break it down, then you have a motivation to break things down if it makes your life easier, right? So there is a, but you need a system you can trust that's also the, if you put it through something that's going to make more work for you, of course, it's not worth it.\nSpeaker ...3326: I will write this on my wall or somewhere that I can read it every day. Yeah, because I see here for example, it's not, this is now unrelated to amp, but I see that majority of people don't take enough time to break down the tasks. But yeah, I guess with this, if you want to use this approach that's the only way.\nSpeaker ...3200: Yeah, it's because as you would know, if you put a big thing into it, the LLM is just going to assume and fill in the gaps and it's probably going to be wrong. I'll just share the, that's the repo for the code. I just showed, you just need to replace the Jira environment variables. There's a readme in there that you could use. But more importantly the amp SDK… because you're one of the rare people who loves a manual.\nSpeaker ...3326: Which I like.\nSpeaker ...3200: SDK has its own manual. And in my opinion that SDK manual is really good. It goes through different use cases with example code as well.\nSpeaker ...3326: Cool. Good stuff.\nSpeaker ...3200: Yeah, I guess, yes, because your team's out of credits and you're still using Kodi, are you, do you know if the team is intending to continue with Kodi or will they transition to amp?\nSpeaker ...3326: I mean, for sure, we will have some AI, but yeah, we're evaluating options now and yeah, you know, it's quite a steep jump from Kodi to amp in terms of pricing. So, I don't know we're now evaluating this. I'm actually not in charge of this. So, one of my colleagues is, but, yeah, before I think the subscription should expire in a couple of months for Kodi. So yeah, we'll see.\nSpeaker ...3200: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3326: We, would, we would love to use amp or some other agentic tool, but yeah, it's just you got.\nSpeaker ...3200: To select. Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker ...3326: And also, it's a big, it's expensive. So, because also, you cannot expect everyone… to know how to use it or there will have to be a lot of education, you know, because people just, they don't read the manuals or search online for best practices. They just start typing and, you know, do this and yeah, then it doesn't work.\nSpeaker ...3200: Fix this. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3326: But then it spends a ton of money. So, yeah, it's a pricing is a problem. So.\nSpeaker ...3200: Yeah. Okay. That's fair enough if you do, if, of course, as long as, you know, get into the tool that works well for you. That's that's great. If you do go with amp, the field engineering team. So we work on these types of use cases, these automation type things. So if you end up implementing something with the SDK, we'd yeah, we'd love to work with you and kind of hack on a solution because that's kind of like what we're really interested in. We're finding that the use cases that custom like we'll go into a customer presenting something. Then what comes back is like, well, we did not expect that workflow, it kind of evolves into like something else… cool. But yeah, there is, a new thing we're experimenting with for some customers. It's not announced yet, which is to do with like user based… not pricing but like controls user based controls in terms of like setting policies and things like that. But yeah, you can talk to, I don't know who you're talking to from my team, but you can have a chat to them about that feature. If that ends up being a blocker for you. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3326: Okay. I'll mention it to one of our guys who is doing it, talking about the contract and related stuff. Yeah, that's for sure. If you could set some policies. Yeah, I think that would be mandatory actually.\nSpeaker ...3200: Yeah, that's fair enough. Awesome. Well, yeah, thank you so much for your time. It was really, nice to meet you. And, yeah, it's actually really nice to hear your using everything like the right way. So, I was actually really impressed.\nSpeaker ...3326: Cool. Yeah, keep up the good work. I guess this has progressed a lot in the last year, I think, yeah.\nSpeaker ...3200: Yeah, it's a big jump for Cody. Yeah, you know?\nSpeaker ...3326: I feel like crippled. Now when I have to use Cody… it's terrible actually. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3200: It's like a compliment and a compliment and a criticism in one.\nSpeaker ...3326: Yeah. Well, cool. So, yeah, take care and keep up the good work, I guess. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3200: Thank you. See you later.\nSpeaker ...3326: Okay. Bye.\nSpeaker ...3200: Bye.",

Yeah.\nSpeaker ...7292: Yeah. Well, not right now, but I'm in New York for that. It was yesterday and the day before it was pretty good.\nSpeaker ...4018: Gotcha. Yeah, cool. Cool. What does that cover?\nSpeaker ...7292: It's just one of those developer conferences I don't know what particularly they're like focused on, but it's like general software development. Oh.\nSpeaker ...4018: Okay.\nSpeaker ...7292: It's pretty good. We had a lot of good companies swing by and we had a booth there. I think I'm excited with like a pretty big freaking big announcement because we made, we have like a free version of amp that has ads I saw.\nSpeaker ...4018: That?\nSpeaker ...7292: Oh, you saw that cool?\nSpeaker ...4018: I saw that? I got the email. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...7292: Oh, okay. Got it. Yep. Yeah. So, yeah, there's a decent amount of buzz around sourcegraph during the event.\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah, that's pretty cool. I imagine that'll be that's the type of thing that we get a lot of people to try it out.\nSpeaker ...7292: Yeah, that's exactly right. I mean, I have like friends and family. I'm like, hey, just use it to build fun stuff. It's free.\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah, that's cool. So, I'm not sure if Dave's going to make it. We've got a pretty busy week over here. So, question… mark on whether or not Dave will make it, and I forwarded this to John nill this morning when I realized he wasn't already on it. We should probably add him to this. He's right now kind of doing a lot of the legwork for this amp, trial. We're spinning up.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay.\nSpeaker ...4018: So, he's probably got more information than I do on that at the moment just because he's been pushing… on that. He's very motivated to get this trial started. So.\nSpeaker ...7292: John nill.\nSpeaker ...4018: John nill. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...7292: Yeah. Have we met with him maybe approved by colleagues? I?\nSpeaker ...4018: Know, Sam has met him. Oh, nice. I'm not sure he's been in the last couple of these. Yeah, I think it's been a while maybe since the kickoff. He was in some of the earliest ones that I was in and then I think he sort of bowed out for a while, so… but he's been, you know, doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes. He's one of the admins for our sourcegraph instance as well. So, he's… up to speed on a lot of it.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. Did you saw that we added the free credits? Was that useful for you all?\nSpeaker ...4018: I saw the, that we had like, the 10 credits… that you get just… for sort of joining, but I'm seeing our balance for amp, right now is zero.\nSpeaker ...7292: Oh, maybe that's it to do that we need to work on.\nSpeaker ...4018: Do you, did? I don't think I sent you any information about our.\nSpeaker ...7292: The workspace name?\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah, the workspace?\nSpeaker ...7292: Oh, okay. Yeah, I would.\nSpeaker ...4018: Okay. All right. Maybe I didn't do that. Well.\nSpeaker ...7292: I think it's lutron def electronics, right?\nSpeaker ...4018: Yep. That's the one.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. Cool. Let's see how many credits you all have. Did you… hey, Dave?\nSpeaker ...4018: Hello? Hi, Dave.\nSpeaker ...7292: Did you all talk about that? All the swap conversation that we were talking about previously?\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah. I brought Dave up to speed on that a little bit. So, I think where we are right now is we're gonna do a trial where we're I think we're just gonna buy a 1,000 dollars in credits and get upgraded to the enterprise tier, so that we can get the sso and zero data retention. And then we're gonna kind of see how far that takes us. So I'm hoping that can give us some useful insights, on amp, compared to Cody. So we're gonna do that before we consider like changing our contract. I don't think we're quite at the point where… we're comfortable kind of pushing that through. The, the cost is like a huge question on that. Okay? So, so, we're gonna try it out and see how far we get.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay.\nSpeaker ...7292: So, I think, remember… I was talking about like the deal minimum of, the five K.\nSpeaker ...4018: We were talking about that. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...7292: But, it might be fine, but I just wanted to run this, run this by you. So, remember how we were talking about this very partial swap. The intention is, you know, just full disclosure. The intention is to make sure our customers do move towards amp and are comfortable with that in the move. But basically, this is your current contract. Your ppu is okay. And if we… need to get to that five K threshold, it does get prorated as I mentioned, with the number of months remaining in the contract which ends on March 20 fifth. But we have the ability to swap out a portion of your licenses, your Kodi licenses, for amp. Basically, what I was trying to figure out are your max Kodi mail, which it hits around 212. But then we, if you have a 1,000 dollar budget, we could decrease the amount that we swap here and increase that figure. But we could swap it in a way that,, you do hit that five K number with a 1,000 plus four K in the swap figure in, the contract. So then the Kodi number would be higher than that. But then you'd have users using amp until March 20 fifth?\nSpeaker ...4018: Okay.\nSpeaker ...7292: The, and as a reminder, it's prorated is the biggest challenge if there's a world where you all were comfortable with, an early renewal of some sort that would that'd make things easier? But I'm trying to work with the assumption that won't be feasible.\nSpeaker ...4018: Right. So, so the issue is that because it's prorated the longer we wait, the more Kodi users we need to swap over to amp credits to hit five K. Is that right? Yeah.\nSpeaker ...7292: Yeah, that's right. And if you do have a 1,000 K budget, we basically want the contract until March to, you have no impact on like, what you intended the contract to be, but then you have the addition of these amp credits. Let me get some… thank you.\nSpeaker ...7292: It's easier on this calculator.\nSpeaker ...7292: Complex man.\nSpeaker ...7292: So if you swapped out 40 seats?\nSpeaker ...7292: To the attention fraction.\nSpeaker ...7292: You need 25 seats? Okay? So, if you dropped your Kodi amount to two five… and then had that 1,000, you would be within the range, if that makes sense.\nSpeaker ...4018: Okay. So it dropped to two five, but, the 1,000, yeah, exactly 1,000 that we, that we're planning to spend. Yeah, hopefully imminently, it doesn't look like it's happened yet because we're still on the team tier team plan, whatever you guys call it. Huh. But… doesn't sound like it's gonna take too long to get that done. So. Okay. So that would count towards that 5,000, right?\nSpeaker ...7292: Yes, correct. Okay. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...4018: That's good.\nSpeaker ...7292: I somewhat need to double check that, but I'm confident that would be the case. I don't see how it would not be the case. I said, what did I say? I said? Two five. So, your max Cody hit in September, which was 212. Would you have designated amp users until March? Do you think you'd have designated amp users? I?\nSpeaker ...4018: Think it depends, it depends on how much it costs us to use in practice and how much better it is. So, like, if the quality to dollar ratio is good enough then we might be willing to, you know, cut more people over. But since it's like, it depends like we have use cases where, you know, Cody is not giving us great results. And if amp can give us really great results in those use cases, then it might be a matter of, you know, maybe for those people, we designate them as amp users and keep sort of, the general population using Cody. I don't know it kind of depends on what we learn in the trial to be honest with you. And we're okay. We're we're kind of trying to design out that trial. Now, it's kind of early.\nSpeaker ...7292: So, like I'm trying to do the math, well, I think it's three… eight, zero. Okay?\nSpeaker ...7292: All right. I think I got the math right? All right. So, I think one thing that we just want to be, hopefully, we conveyed this, but we are vetting everything towards amp, at least from the AI perspective, And that's why we're like trying to do things like the swap because, the nature of like what you're going to get experience wise with Cody.\nSpeaker ...7292: It'll probably be the same but it'll kind of stagnate over time, meaning all our like engineering like firepower is going towards making amp the best tool available. So, I think when you do the trial, you'll see that it… it's much more attractive in terms of a swap scenario.\nSpeaker ...7292: But in the interim, if this is like a step we can take where we create a contract, use that one K prorate, five months. I do need to get this out to you to make sure it's five months because I'm calculating five months until like it's the right, it's a year. So it's like November, December, January, February, March, five months. So ideally, we can sort out the swap, to make sure you get that equivalent of five months in credits. We have a little bit of a buffer. But, that could be a good approach. Did we give you a background on why we completely created amp from scratch versus like trying to continue to improve Cody?\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah, I think so. I think, what I recall there is, you couldn't use some of the more powerful features of the models unless you picked one and optimized for that model, right? Yeah.\nSpeaker ...7292: That's that's kind of, yeah, that's exactly right? So at a very macro, if you think of us like as a company, what we saw is things are getting obsolete very quickly like autocomplete got obsolete by BS code forks, you know, and Cody was kind of like in this bucket as well, with kind of like a rag chat. And then that got obsolete earlier this year with lab specific agentic tools with basically the ability to do more agentic style coding. So we needed an architect amp for a high ceiling. It's kind of the concept and it does revolve heavily around agentic coding, but it also involves our ability to adopt the best models for any given task. So, when we do show you and onboard you onto this trial, what you're going to be able to use amp for? Is this the powerful agentic coding functionality? But you're also going to get things like the ability to do incomplete complex analysis with oracle, and then also a completion engine that, we do not charge you for, so you'll get equivalent of cursor, but it's actually performing better and we don't charge you tokens on that. So that's that alone makes this very, you know, very attractive. But you'll be innovating alongside with us with how we're like researching which models to use for different tasks. And that's where amp's going to be really powerful in the future. You'll also. So we, actually, this is available now, but we can work with you on exploring how to how amp can use sourcegraph's search, MCP, since you're a code search customer. So you will get like we can actually work with you to do that. It's a more advanced functionality.\nSpeaker ...4018: Okay. That sounds that sounds like a good thing for us.\nSpeaker ...7292: Yeah, yeah. It's going to be great, in terms of like stuff we can do, and that's just one MCP. The other thing you can do is use our SDK to do automated code reviews, unit test creation. I'll I can show you the link, but we have an SDK that'll allow you to overlay this if you want to do that. But step one is kind of looking at amp as the engine for your productivity because it's agenting… coding is where the market's moving towards. So, we want to ramp you onto it, train you up on it and then get your team comfortable using it. I have two posts here, and I, when you do start using actually, I should send you the link, but have you heard of Mitchell hashimoto, did I mention it previously?\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. So, he, I'll send you the blog post. I might have sent it to you, but the reason why the blog post is really good is he's actively creating ghosty, right? His next startup essentially, and he's saying he's effectively trying to convince people to use agenting coding because he sees how powerful it is. And it happens that he's using amp because he sees it as the best tool out there right now. But the blog post is powerful because it shows him, it shows you what threads he's creating. And he also uses the oracle and I'll show you how he uses the oracle. So, and he's it's not like he's sponsored, he just, he's just trying to show and teach people how to code in the agentic world. Simon Wilson, co, creator of Django, calls us the most critical independent and terminal coding agent right now. All that to say that the momentums around amp, and we can get it in your hands. Once we get you more comfortable with how powerful it is. And if, you know, step one is to work on this, we can try to move quickly on that just for the case of the, the credits. And if you're comfortable with that,\nSpeaker ...4018: Well, so, so, at this point, in order to change our contract, I think we're gonna need, we're gonna need to defend that decision, right? Like when we go to run up the flagpole, we're gonna need to be able to say that we did a trial and these are the results and this is how much it's gonna cost. We need to justify that change. So, at this point, I don't think we're so much looking at, you know, pulling the trigger on the contract update, Dave, you look like you have something you want to add.\nSpeaker ...3349: When you're done?\nSpeaker ...4018: Right now, we're mostly looking at, at… evaluating the tool and comparing it to what we have today, which is Kodi.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3349: Because the biggest thing in my mind, well, the biggest hurdle for this in my mind is that we don't know how much it's gonna cost, right? Like we have, a very predictable cost structure with Kodi and sourcegraph today, and we don't know if it's gonna be, you know, on par, two X 10 X, 100 X. I have, I really have no idea what.\nSpeaker ...4018: to expect or cheaper. We have no clue, right?\nSpeaker ...3349: Yeah, pretty sure. It's not gonna be cheaper, but, yeah.\nSpeaker ...4018: Probably not depends.\nSpeaker ...3349: Kodi's a pretty, a pretty good deal… like, you can see it in that slide, right? It's like 250 bucks a year per person. So, yeah, that's or a month, I don't know, got it.\nSpeaker ...7292: So.\nSpeaker ...3349: Yeah, it's we're… in the, like, everything is changing very rapidly and that's a challenge for us because as an organization in these kinds of cases, it's a little hard for us to move that quickly. We're still trying to figure out how to move that quickly. And there are lots of options out there. It looks like amp, is the best one but… yeah, it's gonna, if we have to go back and say, you know, hey, we need, you know, a half 1,000,000 dollars in the budget for this. You know, we gotta have something really good behind it. And so, we really have to get our hands on it and try it and we don't wanna, we don't wanna like just cut over and then say, well, we hit our budget so nobody can use the tool for the rest of the year when we get like three months in or something. You know what I mean? Like, okay, we gotta get, some… data to go off of.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. Got it. So, even the, like the hybrid swap option, would not work is that.\nSpeaker ...4018: It's it's not a thing we can do like right now. Like we have to go do the trial first if we come out of the trial, and we're like, yeah, we're gonna do it and, you know, maybe we say we'll take, you know, X number of people and make them designated amp users, then we can do that. And then the hybrid swap would make a lot of sense. It just, it just depends we have to, and honestly, like we kind of have to design the trial to get the right data that we're looking for. Yeah, in terms of, you know, who we include in the trial.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay.\nSpeaker ...7292: So, let's,\nSpeaker ...4018: let.\nSpeaker ...7292: me check with the team on… the one K.\nSpeaker ...7292: Because it seems like, this hybrid concept where we offer the five K through a swap. It sounds like that's gonna be really difficult.\nSpeaker ...4018: I mean, it depends right? Like, you know, if, in a, if we go do this trial and in a month or a month and a half, we say this is great. You know, how many seats do we need to cut over to hit that five K? Then maybe it's like, okay, sure. That number's fine. Okay. Or, or, you know, maybe we treat this, as a, I don't know it's gonna depend, on what makes sense for us. I think we can talk about those options once we've decided, okay, you know, what makes sense for us?\nSpeaker ...7292: Yeah. All right. I can add, I think… 250 credits to your environment,\nSpeaker ...4018: That'd be great. Thank you.\nSpeaker ...7292: Yeah, but I don't know if that'll be enough for the testing. Are you gonna like you'll need the one K essentially for the testing to get over the hump for like a little bit larger of a swap. Yeah, maybe you can walk me through what would be ideal for you all. And then, we can try to execute on that, for the testing phase?\nSpeaker ...3349: I think my understanding of, where the one K kind of comes in is we want to get to the, to that enterprise level where we have the zero data retention like that's?\nSpeaker ...4018: And sso, yeah, right? Like, that's the primary, if we don't have that, we're not doing it like, so like we have to get there, we have to get there. So we can even start the testing. That's really why we're talking about the one K thing because it's not that hard to get, you know, a 1,000 dollars.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. All right. So.\nSpeaker ...4018: That's that's really why we did that.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. I think, and, the reason why I'm like trying to figure out how to execute on that, I think you can just,\nSpeaker ...7292: Let me, let me look into like what we can do, I think our target is try to get you to swap. So let me see what options.\nSpeaker ...4018: We have. So, yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and I get that, like if the tool's better, then cool. Let's you know, we'll figure out we'll figure out how we can work it, into our process.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. All right. So, for the near term, we need to get to the enterprise tier. Let me, let me, talk with the team on that and see what's the best path. And then, okay. And then we'll try to get that started. Once, we do have that in place, let's assume that we'll figure that out what's, the next step after that's sorted out. Do you have an enterprise environment with, you know, a 1,000 in tokens? Will you have a Sperry type group? Like, yeah, maybe, we can talk about like, what do you think will be the testing? Will it revolve around, you just validating the costs won't be too high, for tests or what are you all thinking for criteria?\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah. So, so basically, what I'm kind of considering right now and we're still haven't really designed the trial yet. But, you know, I'm looking at finding some power users that can kind of tell us, you know, worst case, what a power user is going to spend on this, which I don't think is going to be hard for us to find. We've got some very motivated people. And then I want to find some of the people who have not had great results with Kodi so far and get them involved and see so that they can tell us if the quality of the tool is that much better. And then based on that, you know, we can try it over some period of time, and evaluate the spend and evaluate the quality and hopefully make a decision based on that. So, I don't think it'd be a huge group especially if, you know, we're going to keep the number of credits relatively low. So I don't know maybe a couple 12 people. I don't expect them all to be power users though.\nSpeaker ...7292: Yeah. The power users, as we talked previously, Kyle, and, when we do the trial, it'll if it's a power user, it'll show the token usage on a daily framework… as insanely high. And then when you multiply by 250, it'll look like it's way higher than in practice would happen. So.\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah. So I'm going to, so I'm going to go, I'm going to basically look at, our Kodi metrics, figure out who's using the tool a lot and try to come up with, you know, a rough estimate for, you know, if we assume the same distribution of usage, what does that look like? Just a rough swag? I know that I can't just take a power user, multiply it by 250 and say, here's what we expect that would be like worst case.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay, got.\nSpeaker ...4018: It not a realistic budget.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. If we can, if I go get approval on this, if we can like give you the upgrade for speed purposes, and then, essentially just front the token cost… instead of we having to do paperwork. Could that get us faster to, the testing and then the potential swap of licenses?\nSpeaker ...4018: Sure. Yeah. I mean, if that's a thing we can do, then that's definitely an option. I don't know where John is in the process, of getting, that 1,000 dollars signed off. I would assume, you know, if and when that happens, we would just add that on top of, whatever credits we have in the account already, which I don't think would be a problem… which, you know, might be zero at that point or might be 250 depends on, you know, whatever, or some other number. I don't.\nSpeaker ...7292: know, yeah, because we're gonna give you 250 and there'll be an upgraded account so effectively, you could start on, start this process on Monday.\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah. I think getting sso set up, you know, any guidance you can give us, on how we would execute that would probably help because I imagine that would be, the next roadblock for us.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. Got it. Let's, let's make that the next step. So we'll just get you started with, the credits that we already have and get your environment to that enterprise raid. So you get sso, so we can move this along and then, how long do you, anticipate us in the testing? You said a month roughly?\nSpeaker ...4018: Maybe give or take, you know, if we get, if we get amazing results in the first two weeks, then maybe that's enough. Okay. Depends.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. Can we, I'll get a solution engineer for the, do you want to do like a kickoff of sorts on how to use it?\nSpeaker ...4018: If you think that's helpful? Yeah, I mean, to what extent? Is it different in terms of how you would use it? To, what extent? Is it different from Kodi? Like to the point where we would need to train people on it?\nSpeaker ...7292: So, it's Kodi is just like chat and completions, so they need to get more comfortable using agentic, and a, the agentic framework of like coding. So, and also, there's like more advanced features like when to call on the oracle to do something. And I think something like that would be helpful. I think at a minimum, a Q a plus demo will be a, good starting point. Sure we.\nSpeaker ...4018: Can do that.\nSpeaker ...7292: Yeah. Okay. Would you want to do that next week or, you still need to like get the group together?\nSpeaker ...4018: So, I think we need to get the group together, and next week, we're doing, our massive planning session. So it is a, an uncommonly bad week to try to schedule literally anything. So I'd say, if we were going to do that, probably the week after would be more appropriate. Now, if we can get people set up and started on this, then, you know, I'm willing to just turn some people loose and, yeah, yeah, that.\nSpeaker ...7292: Actually is better.\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah, just so that we don't need.\nSpeaker ...7292: to, so then we can do a Q a.\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah, then, yeah, you might be able to kind of get things moving and then, yeah… yeah, that's a good idea. Q a might be, a good way to do that.\nSpeaker ...7292: It is designed to be like, kind of like self serve. So then maybe, the demo is more of a Q a if they have questions and then we can show more advanced things.\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Okay?\nSpeaker ...7292: All right. Let's let's do that. So, you don't we don't use slack with you. All right. No, it's email. Okay. Yeah, we use teams internally. So, all right. Let me loop in a solution engineer, get your sso set up. If you can get, start inviting team members into that environment. Does it. So the 1,000, is that like something you're gonna be taking care of? Or if, as I mentioned, what if we fronted that for speed?\nSpeaker ...4018: I don't think that it's gonna be a problem for us to get the 1,000. Okay. I'll ask John right now?\nSpeaker ...7292: Is there a scenario where you'd, keep… your 250, but then you see the value of amp, and then you just buy credits on top of that or you'd want to?\nSpeaker ...4018: Swap? Yeah, it's possible totally possible. I mean, if we find, you know, in the trial that we have a lot of success with amp, for very specific use cases, then that could be a, you know, a use as needed kind of tool. I don't know that, that's how that's gonna go though. Okay. Got it. Yeah, I think.\nSpeaker ...7292: It's so this actually, the better question, is the swap interesting? I'm assuming it is interesting because then you'd be swapping over to, okay. Cool.\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah. I mean, if we've got, you know, some people that are working on the types of technologies where amp is just, you know, step change better in terms of, you know, output quality then yeah, they probably wouldn't have much need to use Kodi anymore and just cut them over. That'd. Be my guess.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. Got it.\nSpeaker ...3349: Quick question. Yeah. And you may have said this already or you may have answered it in other conversations, but is there a way to look at our Kodi usage and make any kind of association to… how many tokens would that correlate to in amp?\nSpeaker ...7292: They're pretty different in terms of products. I think we can try to, I can try to see if we do have token usage numbers for Kodi, right? But I don't know if that's apples to apples in terms of when we do that comparison.\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah. Well, I mean if it could get us in.\nSpeaker ...3349: The.\nSpeaker ...4018: if it could get us in the ballpark, that might still be like a useful talking point, right?\nSpeaker ...3349: If it's in the same aisle of the produce department, then maybe.\nSpeaker ...7292: Yeah. Okay. Let me.\nSpeaker ...4018: because right now, the conversation goes something like there's this tool we hear is great and we have literally no clue how much it'll cost and they're like I.\nSpeaker ...7292: see.\nSpeaker ...4018: You're crazy like you have to give us something to go on. So if we could at least have like a ballpark number and say it's not exactly the same but here's broad strokes the order of magnitude that this thing would cost us, that would, I think go a long way. I'm hoping that, you know, the trial will tell us something useful as well. But again, it's hard to really predict what the real world spend would be because it depends on who you include in the trial and what they're working on. Yeah. So like even that, I don't really expect that to, you know, cleanly scale up, you know, kind of linearly with users. So even that's really supposed to get a ballpark.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. Yeah. Let me look into that. I'll pose that question to our team. And yeah, if I do have something I'll get back to you. All right. So in the meantime, I will try to loop in my, or loop in my solution engineer. It sounds like you're working on the 1,000 and then.\nSpeaker ...7292: I'll add the 250, and then if you can add your team members and they can start using that 250, then that'll be a good blend.\nSpeaker ...4018: Okay. We might, we might want to get the enterprise plan upgraded. Yeah. Before we start pulling in more users just so that, you know, we can, you know, make sure we've got sso in place and the zero data retention thing is kind of a big deal for us too. So. Okay. So that would be kind of a prerequisite for, before we start pulling in more users. And I also have to still go figure out who I'm going to even ask… which will probably have to be a next week kind of task for me.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. I,\nSpeaker ...4018: gotcha. But yeah, that's definitely those would be the next steps I think.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. Yeah. And if we need to cover that 1,000, I don't know if the 1,000 would take away from a hypothetical five K investment of any sort. If that's the case. If there's like a path to like the minimum number, then I think we'd probably just front the 1,000, right? Because it's like below that deal minimum. Like is it taking out of some budget that could hypothetically be allocated in the future to a true deal where we use an order form and then execute on the five K? Do you know what I mean?\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah. I think so. I think I see what you're saying like are we?\nSpeaker ...7292: Taking budget out of because the budget numbers aren't too high, right? It's like one K versus five K.\nSpeaker ...4018: Yeah, it's not a huge deal. I mean, it's like there are a lot of different ways that could go, you know, once we decide what we're going to do and it's possible. We just say, you know, here's a po for 5,000 dollars in credits and we'll prorate… I don't know, man. I think we're going to have to, we're… going to have to figure that out.\nSpeaker ...7292: Okay. All right. Well, in the meantime, we will get you going and then try to schedule office hours on the week after next.\nSpeaker ...4018: Sounds good.\nSpeaker ...7292: All right. Sounds good. All right. Thanks.\nSpeaker ...4018: All right. Thanks so much.\nSpeaker ...7292: See you. Bye, see you.\nSpeaker ...4018: See you.",

How's your week been so far?\nSpeaker ...2703: Busy.\nSpeaker ...9690: Yeah, same here. Seemingly doesn't stop, but, you know, I've got the light at the end of the tunnel with the holidays coming up. So, yeah, a few more weeks and we'll be on our way. Yeah, sorry, I saw your email like, I guess 30, 40 minutes ago, and responded just with regards to adding like the full data to the dashboard that we have internally. It's a pretty big, just in terms of like logistics. It's a pretty big lift. So I figured we could start with kind of like a short presentation from a member of our analytics team. I don't know if it'll be Dan or Kelsey or both of them. Okay? If you have any questions and kind of go from there, if that sounds okay. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...2703: Perfectly fine. I mean, I think just generally, we obviously need to be able to track the units that we're being billed against, right? So at some point we're going to need to get visibility into that, but we can take it a step at a time that's fine.\nSpeaker ...9690: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And yeah, I think we had like a few creative solutions there potentially that we could walk through. Okay? But, yeah, Kelsey, do you want to, thanks for joining by the way? Do you want to like quickly introduce yourself? And then we can maybe get started.\nSpeaker ...2703: I think let's maybe pause for a second. I think Antonio on our team is going to join as well. Okay, great. Let me ping him, oh.\nSpeaker ...9690: Oh, there's Dan. So it's both of them. Awesome. Yeah, perfect.\nSpeaker ...2703: And let me ping Antonio. Oh, there he is.\nSpeaker ...9690: Cool.\nSpeaker ...9690: Hey, Antonio. I think you're on, yeah, you're on mute. Unfortunately… okay, happens to the best of us.\nSpeaker ...8206: Hello, everybody. Happy Friday.\nSpeaker ...9690: Happy Friday. Cool. I was talking to serge just a moment ago and figured like I'd let Kelsey and Dan introduce themselves. Then we jump into some of the kind of my metering metrics as described in our last conversation and over email, I know Dan has to drop partway through the call.\nSpeaker ...9690: So definitely want to get this out of the way first, and then we can kind of continue the discussion on, you know, the true op and the quote for next year, if that makes sense. Sounds.\nSpeaker ...2703: Good. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...8206: Sounds good.\nSpeaker ...3006: I'll go first. I'm Dan, I'm our head of finance operations here at sourcegraph. I've been in the company for almost a decade. Now. I manage our data and analytics team which is responsible for data collection, recording, tracking, and billing metering. And so, yeah, I'm here to help, you know, answer the questions and sort of guide the conversation as much as I can. Yeah, ultimately, a lot of this is, you know, a… getting into the weeds and the details, but also at the same time, there's a lot of high level just sort of understanding and communication about how the plan itself works and the philosophy behind it that's probably worth aligning on. So, happy to start either at the low end or the high end, whatever you all are more interested in. I'll let Kelsey do next.\nSpeaker ...8206: Yeah. I'm Kelsey, I work on the analytics team here. So I'm happy to help kind of dive into any details that we need to, but I've been here for about a little over four years now.\nSpeaker ...2703: Awesome. Cool.\nSpeaker ...9690: Yeah. Serge, what would be like most helpful here? I know like we covered a bit over email, would it be helpful to reiterate some of those points and then dive in?\nSpeaker ...2703: Yeah. Maybe let me help establish the context of why we're having this conversation. So we did a download of all the events for each of our users over the last year or so. And what we're finding is that the actual number of active users is somewhere in the vicinity of 500 versus the six, something that you guys are reporting in the dashboard. And so, what came out of that conversation as Sam said, well, the events that you are able to get an extract from the system doesn't actually cover all of the events. And then we said, well, we kind of need to know what the events are if we're being charged for them, right? And so that brings us here today and effectively, we'd like to understand what are the other events that users are triggering… to be identified as active users? Number one? And number two is how do we get access to that data, right? Obviously, we need to be able to have access to it and be able to crunch through it for our purposes.\nSpeaker ...3006: Makes sense. And yeah, this is a great conversation. We, we have this, we get this question once in a while, the important thing to know… it's trying to report on a set of specific metrics. Not just here's, a comprehensive list of everything you can do in sourcegraph, you can, you know, number of page views, number of logins, those aren't particularly interesting metrics. So we don't put all of those into the report because we find it the most valuable things. The things that we tie to value, the things that we tie to, you know, our calculator of like hours saved dollars, saved metrics. Ultimately that those are the things that we put into the download, its number of searches, its number of code intelligence actions, its number of batch changes merged, and so on. So you hopefully, that makes sense that the report itself is intended to be capturing some of those bigger things. Some of those things that, you know, we report on in terms of the sort of value, the value metrics that said, the way our pricing works is not that, you know, you only pay if you do some minimum number of these specific set of six actions. The way the product works is if you log in a given month, then you're a billable active user, our belief, you know, formed over many years of talking to customers and using the product ourselves is that value comes from many different places and people sharing a link to the product, other people clicking through that link, browsing around a few pages, looking at the files, clicking on a link to a search results page, for example, someone else ran the search. And then you click to the link of results that's still value at the end of the day. And those actions of viewing those results, viewing the output of that search still counts as a billable active user in a given month, we document what makes a user active? Per our definition of monthly active users. I think I'll try and find that.\nSpeaker ...2703: And in fact, that was one of my questions is as I was flipping through the documents, I couldn't find anything that defined. Mau… and I'm wondering if I don't see, I don't know if this is a question to you is if you can flip through the documents and point my eyes towards that?\nSpeaker ...3006: Yeah. Let me find this for you. Remember that. There we go. So the page I think that Kelsey shared is more about our analytics platform, but let me share our actual definition of billable usage. Here's the page. Let me find a subheader. I'll just share the screen and I'll share the link as well. Okay. Here's the link… and here is the screen. So if you go to how are active users calculated for sourcegraph code, search and code intelligence platform, our definition is a billable active code search or code intelligence platform user is signed to and accessing sourcegraph. This is included but not limited to visiting a sourcegraph web application or using a browser extension editor extension, or other client while signed in, conducting a search, hovering or navigating code, viewing a file, viewing a repository, creating viewing or receiving a code monitor, creating viewing, modifying or applying a batch, change, code insights and more. But it's not limited to just these actions. Ultimately, the definition is someone who's signed into and accessing a sourcegraph product, someone who chooses to visit a sourcegraph product while signed into the product. We do show reporting in the sourcegraph analytics page of that we don't show every possible user action. We don't have code monitor creation, code monitor, viewing code monitor being sent. There's just hundreds of potential actions that we could list in there for different user activities. We list a handful of valuable sort of summary metrics like number of searches that were run and so on. You can use it via the API and more. But we don't list out every possible user action. Yet, hundreds of columns in your export spreadsheet, if we were to do that.\nSpeaker ...2703: Dan, how do we get? Ultimately? What we're trying to figure out is who… are the active users and how are they using the system? And have they taken full advantage of their system or if they're casual users that perhaps can be using something else? Yeah, right. So to that point, what we're looking for is a pretty comprehensive view of well… effectively a complete view of how you guys are counting users, right? So you're saying it's 620 something or other, right? So there must be a system that is a counter that says, serge logged in. Therefore he's an active user this month, but the next, you know, last month he didn't log in. So he's not an active user, right? So you must have all that data saying somewhere, the question, is, how do you guys, how can you guys expose that to us?\nSpeaker ...3006: So that we can certainly share the full list of users and we can show a counter of all, you know, billable actions in a month or number of days active or things like that. If you'd like I will say though that the actual list of user events are not necessarily human readable and understandable lists. They're sort of code named in many cases. And so you're not necessarily going to be able to see like, oh, this user did, you know, action, you know, code dot references dot, you know, I mean whatever like they're not necessarily human readable things. And so us going in and sort of tagging everything for you. It would certainly take some time there's a reason we aggregate these into sort of a handful of buckets, the analysis we ran. And also, of course, a product is evolving quickly. And so, you know.\nSpeaker ...2703: So if we were, if we were to come back and say, hey Dan, we need to audit the number of users that you guys are reporting. Yes, how would you, how do you respond to that? I mean, I'm sure we're not the first client to ask for that data.\nSpeaker ...3006: Yeah. The export, the CSV export is typically the way we do this. And I see that 517 users had numbers in your report for the month and 628 total users showed up in that month. So about 18 percent appeared with all zeros in there. We certainly can provide a specific list of those users which I guess you already have the list of those users. We've done some sort of, we picked a handful randomly and shown you some examples of what they did. We can share a longer list and just sort of have a, you know, an output spit out of encoded event names. If you'd like we can talk through any number of them, live with you. If you'd like if you want to randomly pick user ids, we can go pull them up and walk you through them, but I don't think it's I don't think there's going to be an easy export. We can give you that's going to say like, you know, on your side, this user, you know, passed my mental bar as to what a valuable user action was versus not, right there's going to be some level of subjectivity there that we can't necessarily provide you a report. Is that is going to answer that you?\nSpeaker ...2703: Don't you don't need to do that. We're not asking you for that input. I think what we're asking you for is what events occurred across our user population that caused them to be counted as an Mau?\nSpeaker ...3006: Yeah. They signed, they active access the site or signed in?\nSpeaker ...2703: Well, what else did they do? Right? Did they access the site every day? Did they do a 1,000 searches a day or did search just log in and then log out and then do a thing?\nSpeaker ...3006: Yep. So.\nSpeaker ...2703: That's that's what I need to get to.\nSpeaker ...3006: Yeah, absolutely. I think, you know, I'm trying to think of how we can give something that's actually useful here that's not just a bunch of like code names, well?\nSpeaker ...2703: You guys have a dictionary for the events, right? So, if you have 100 events even if they're in code, there must be a dictionary somewhere to say this is what these are, right?\nSpeaker ...3006: We have them categorized. So, billable, non billable, active, non active products the product is associated with. And so we have various categories that we, that are obviously associated with each event. And we keep this continuously updated but not like a human readable description of all of them. Let me, we'll work on trying to get some sort of report that gives you like more visibility into this. I'm sure. We can just give you the export. I suspect they're going to be readable enough that you'll be able to get a sense for them. We'll go generate something to give you here so that you can look at it. But, and if you have questions, you can follow up with us, I suppose if that works for you.\nSpeaker ...2703: Yeah. I mean, ultimately, we need to tie the numbers into what you guys are telling us are the maus and the monthly basis, right?\nSpeaker ...3006: So, yeah.\nSpeaker ...2703: With whatever that report is, right? And if there's a bunch of activities that are non billable, meaning they don't count as a contribution towards the Mau status. I don't particularly need to see them, right? I only care about the events that trigger an Mau status.\nSpeaker ...3006: Absolutely. Yeah, we'll take a look at the report, make sure it's not like totally impossible to digest, but we can get you something that hopefully has is understandable. Yeah, we'll get you that. I think it's important to, I do want to pull the conversation up a little bit from the report. You know, obviously in any given month, someone absolutely will click on a link, go look at a page and then close the window and that'll be it. And that person in that given month will count as a monthly active user for billing purposes because they signed into the site, they opened a page, looked at a file that was sent to them as a link, whether it's search results, whether it's a page, whether it's a repo page, who knows whatever it may be, and then close it, and that will count as a billable active user in the month. There absolutely will be some number of users who qualify for that. In the report. I don't know what the percentage is going to be. Is it five percent? Is it one percent? Is it nine percent? I don't know, but I'm sure you'll see that in there. But ultimately, the way we count active users will still include those users, but only on the months when they do it because we have monthly billing or monthly active user accounting. We start from zero at the start of every month. If a user consumes an active user seat in that month, they have to actually proactively do that. They have to come to the site, view it, use it. And then in order to count for a given month, so deleting like a user account won't actually, you know, quote unquote, you know, solve this or keep them out. They can always just come back the next month. It's really only if someone actually chooses to visit the site, will they be counted in any given month?\nSpeaker ...2703: Understood. I mean, I think that's a second order of work that we need to do, right? Is we have to determine that, say, hey, if surge visits sourcegraph once a month, stays on there for three seconds and then leaves, surge should not have a sourcegraph account… right? Because he's not gaining any value from it.\nSpeaker ...3006: I think our debate not getting any value from it depends on the page he viewed depends on what he did on that page. He got a question. He got an answer.\nSpeaker ...2703: Again, that is the second order of discussion, right? I mean, the first order of discussion is how big is this population, right? Who are the active people, right? So we're looking at the data and there's a bunch of folks who, you know, half of the population is casual… what I would call casual users. They have very few transactions, right? And so a big part of the question for us is should those people have these accounts? And internally, we're working through that conversation, but it isn't clear that a, they're getting a ton of value from it or B that we're getting the Roi off them having access to sourcegraph.\nSpeaker ...3006: I would encourage you to look at multiple months of data for any individual user. If somebody doesn't sign in a month, of course, they wouldn't be billed for that month. But even if someone only signs in one time in October, they may sign in 30 times in September or zero times in September and not even count as a billable user in September. It is a challenging exercise given our active… user based billing is more generous. From the perspective of you only get billed. If you actually use it, right? You don't get billed for just occupying a seat for a year, never actually signing in. But from the other perspective, it does mean that it becomes harder to look at a given period of time, whether that's one day, one week, one month, and say, oh, this user doesn't deserve the ability to access it anymore because they didn't use it in this week or this month. So just want to warn you in advance that you're probably going to have people then try to sign in the next month and someone else won't sign in the next month. And do you swap their seat, you know?\nSpeaker ...2703: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...3006: So it's a hard question.\nSpeaker ...2703: The challenge we have is if you look at the data, right? And I think it's actually shown in your own dashboards. Is our daily active users are somewhere around 200, right? So that's you know, whereas… the monthly user count, the maus are in the low 600, right? So that isn't terrific.\nSpeaker ...3006: The average user uses it 10 days per month. In that case, that's how often you know, I would say, I will say that, you know, a single visit to the site can be well worth well, more than a single visit to the product can be worth well more than the cost of a user seat in a given month. I think we feel maybe confident in the value that sourcegraph delivers for people who actively use the product.\nSpeaker ...2703: No, I'm not surprised to hear that from you. I think that part of that is sort of the second order of discussion that we need to have internally is where do we draw the line?\nSpeaker ...3006: Of course, but.\nSpeaker ...2703: We need data, right? So, you know, the first level of analysis, we see a big gap between what we're seeing as active versus what you're reporting as active, right? And so we need to close that gap to zero. And so, this is the purpose of this conversation, right? And obviously, there's additional discussion that follows it.\nSpeaker ...3006: I do think that you're going to, yeah, that totally makes sense. I understood. And I get the desire in general to keep costs as low as possible and make sure that you're getting a positive return on everything you're working on everything you're investing in. The way the product works is we try to make it accessible to everybody so people can get that value when they need it. But they're only getting billed when they actually get value out of it when they actually use the product. And so, our monthly active user billing model is designed to save you money because you're not getting billed for people who don't use it in a given month. I would caution you that if you go in and start to say because in the month of October or September, these users were active more than three times, they count as people who deserve to use the product. And these other people do not, you're going to see trouble next month. When the person who signed in three times in September decides, oh, I don't need it this month, but someone else does need it. You'd be net zero on cost, but you're going to have to deal with internal demand changing there. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...2703: Understood.\nSpeaker ...9690: It might be worth mentioning as well. I finally actually got the chance to meet hudson today. I'm relatively new to working with factset. He did mention that I was kind of asking. So in the coming months in the coming year, what is your position on growth? Yeah, you know, the opposite of growth. And the word that stuck out to me was organic. You know, he mentioned that they're not necessarily looking to remove users or add users. You just kind of want to let it flow. And we have seen a fairly modest, but I guess you could say organic increase in usage from the first month of the contract in 20 23 to present. So I just wanted to caution that it does seem like there is internal demand and that also might be represented by the I believe 1900 user accounts that currently have access to sourcegraph which is different than a monthly active user who is again like signing in using the product in a given month. So those users might come and go depending on the demand and what their current needs are at any given time. But there is still like a, every month there are 606 140 users actively using sourcegraph in a given month out of that 1900 user base. So just wanted to bring that up as something that we covered briefly.\nSpeaker ...2703: Fair enough. Just for transparency, there's definitely 600 people using the system every month. I think the question is how active are they? And that's the word. And again, this is more internal, but I think it's helpful for you guys to have some insight as to what's going on this side of the wall, if you will. In terms of looking at this right hand and, you know, part of this is because we have a mandate to manage costs and deal with it. You know, two years ago that wasn't the environment, but the environment has changed, right? And so it is what it is, right? Just stepping back a little bit, Dan, can you set our expectations on when we should expect to see the data?\nSpeaker ...3006: We'll pull something and like make sure it's understandable. Hopefully we should be able to send something over by Monday. I don't think that should be too tough. Is that reasonable on your side?\nSpeaker ...2703: Let's talk.\nSpeaker ...3006: about it a little bit internally and make sure that it's not going to be like sending over a cryptic, you know? Yeah. So we'll get back to you that's, my hope is Monday, we'll work through Sam on that.\nSpeaker ...2703: Perfect. OK, perfect. I think the only other, I think this is probably a good place to pause the data discussion. I think the only other point… of discussion Sam that we had was on the unit price and we began this conversation. I think in the last call and… where are we on that?\nSpeaker ...9690: Yeah. And Dan Kelsey, if that's kind of the conclusion of the data side, feel free to drop, appreciate your presence.\nSpeaker ...3006: Thanks guys.\nSpeaker ...2703: OK.\nSpeaker ...9690: Thank you. Yep. Cool. All right. So, yeah, thanks for bringing that up. So… I spoke with our finance team and proposed keeping one year flat. I think the last time we spoke, we mentioned one year flat or two years flat renewal. I know that you are seeking a further discount on the price per user per year. Our finance team looked at the historical increase in the account and they would like to adhere to the previous contracts like verbiage relating to that. I think it's a seven percent increase per year. So, our proposal as it stands today is a one year at a modest seven percent increase or a two year agreement at a completely flat renewal rate. So there'd be no change to pricing at all.\nSpeaker ...2703: OK. How does that square up with our request for price reduction?\nSpeaker ...9690: Yeah. And it's a good question. And again, I asked, you know, given that I mentioned that either would be flat, I asked for that, I wasn't able to get it. I was able to do two years flat, one year at a modest increase regarding the discount that you're seeking… again. Like I think it's worth reiterating that you folks are probably like one of the lowest paying price per user per your customers that we have you're very far below our, again, I think I mentioned this on our last call at our floor price by a substantial margin. And because of that, we're not able to offer a further discount. I would truly like love to give you more wiggle room on the price, but our finance team is very firm that the lowest price we can offer is the current 279 if you were to pursue a two year deal.\nSpeaker ...2703: I don't think we're looking at a two year deal. I mean, we'll take that back to the team and have that conversation, but I don't think this is something that was on the table. The… the 279 is problematic, right? It's 279, is roughly 52 percent discount. There are, very few enterprise deals that are done at 52 percent discounts, right? That's that's just completely out of the norm on the low end, right? So, most software deals are, you know, SaaS deals are somewhere in the 80 percent range. And so, the question… to you is, how do we, how do we escalate this competition up, right? Because I think the feedback that you're giving us is a hard one to accept.\nSpeaker ...9690: Yeah. I mean, I think on one hand there is, you know, the percent number is a bit arbitrary, the pricing that you currently have as.\nSpeaker ...2703: A software pricing?\nSpeaker ...9690: Well, yeah, exactly. Right. But I mean, specifically, like, you know, throwing out like a 50 percent or a 60 percent or a 70 percent because the contract previously based on our old pricing model was in fact 70 percent. As it stands today, our pricing has changed. It is now a 50 percent discount because.\nSpeaker ...2703: prices.\nSpeaker ...9690: Yep. And so… because of that, you know, we're happy to offer a flat renewal at the current rate which was satisfactory during the last renewal period… but it's been, it's.\nSpeaker ...2703: not satisfactory, right? So that's the issue.\nSpeaker ...9690: Can I ask what's changed internally? Is this, is this something that's related to fact sets? Like cash flow? Is it related to a deal? But I guess I'd love to learn more about that, if that.\nSpeaker ...2703: We're we're taking a closer look at all of our contracts, right? And we're being extrajudicial about how we think about how contracts are priced and how to what extent they are competitive in a market space, particularly given fact sets, name and sort of stature in the industry, right? And so what we're finding and Antonio and I have this conversation five times a day, I think. But what we're finding is there's a lot of room for improvement of pricing with a lot of contracts, right? And, you know, we're having the very same conversation we're having with you today, you know, we're doing this, you know, times 100 with other vendors, right? So… you know, it's a different environment like you said, two years ago, this probably would have been signed off without a blank, but it's not two years ago, right? And there is focus on costs and we're looking at the contract 50 percent discount rate on the enterprise deal is pretty terrible. You know, I call that the surge price, right? So the surge works into the off the street. And once it wants to buy a couple of licenses, that, that's effectively what surge would get, right? We think that that's that you get better pricing than surge.\nSpeaker ...8206: Sure. If you look at our stock as well, you could see that we are, we do need, you know, it's been a rough road for us in the last this past year. And we go through a lot of software optimization meetings where we're trying to figure out where can we consolidate that? And so the better light that we could put in with sourcegraph. The more it goes under the radar. I would, you know, that's the feedback I would give management because if not, then it's just something that we just tag and to review for potential consolidation. So that's all.\nSpeaker ...9690: Sure. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...2703: I was going to say oftentimes we find it's helpful to bump this up to. I don't know what your structure is if you have a VP or rvp or you go up directly to your CRO, but oftentimes it's helpful to get those conversations get going. And I don't want to delay this because I do, I think there is a notice period.\nSpeaker ...9690: Yeah, that's right. I believe the negotiations have been moved up to November fourteenth. So we've got a little less than a month. Yeah. I'm with you on that. Like obviously like want to make this work with you and to your point on the environment changing totally understand like money is more expensive, interest rates still higher.\nSpeaker ...9690: Like I don't know, are they going to come down? Maybe we'll see, right? And you know that I would say that does cut both ways. You know, like what might be fact sets, problem with requiring a lower rate could be in fact sourcegraph's problem with requiring a higher rate. So we feel that a flat two year renewal is advantageous to both sides. I do take your point that, you know, reviewing this again with our finance team and I can tell you a little bit more about the structure. I, we have a deal desk team that lives within finance, you know, they approve, they reject, they modify every customer quote that we send out. I'm happy to take this back to them and see if we can make an adjustment here. I can't guarantee that. And because of that for right now, like I unfortunately, I have to remain firm at the 279 86.\nSpeaker ...2703: I don't think 279 is going to work, candidly, right? So I'm trying to avoid, you know, a… level of frustration that comes with, you know, us pushing in opposite directions, which is why I suggested, you know, we often get into the deal desk and sort of, you know, my description of deal desk is typically is where good deals go to die. So sometimes they're helpful. Sometimes they're not right? I don't know how yours is, you know, but in general, deal desks are not particularly helpful. Oftentimes we need somebody with authority to step in and say, I get the situation, I'm going to override them. And so that's our ask, right? Is certainly go back to the deal desk. I think 279, is unworkable. You know, again, our perspective is I'm going to pull up my spreadsheet?\nSpeaker ...9690: Yeah, because I would be curious. I'm sorry for interrupting. I would be curious to like from your perspective, understand like, what is workable? Just so I have numbers on my plate, right?\nSpeaker ...2703: Absolutely. So that's what I was looking up. So 80 percent discount gets us to roughly 120, right? So you've got 280 in the table. So we're pretty far apart… right? And so this is the challenge, of the 50 percent discount, right? It's so far out of sync with industry pricing. Yeah, it creates a big gap.\nSpeaker ...9690: Yeah, I hear you. That number… sounds very at first glance, sounds unrealistic unfortunately. And what I'll probably do is create, you know, the… go from the one year agreement at 299 45 and bring that down to something that's more agreeable percentage based because historically like that has been the price increase. Again, like I think that the 279… is advantageous. But I, you know, I think we're kind of talking in circles a little bit. So your point is well taken that, you know, this is brought back to my team for further discussion and remitting that back to you. But again… I think it's worth just saying over time that there's there aren't promises… that I can make like right now on this call today, I understand.\nSpeaker ...2703: I completely appreciate that, right? And I know at some point things get out of your control and you don't have authority to give us 120, which is the reason why I'm asking for an escalation up to whoever holds the pen on this, right? And, and ideally, that's not the deal desk, right? Because they are balanced certain standards as well, right? So they don't particularly hold the pen to anything either… right? So, I think that's the next step that's our ask is if you can run this up the chain and have this conversation, right? I mean, I think, and part of this obviously is going to influence, you know, to what degree are we going to push the envelope on the number of users versus, the price, right? And, as the price stays high, we're going to be a lot more vigilant about the number of users we have in the account. If we get closer to our 120 number on the unit price, we're probably going to be a little more relaxed on, how aggressive we get on reducing the number of users in the system?\nSpeaker ...9690: Yep understood. And, you know, I'd respond to that and say that again, like it's there are going to be questions raised, if the number of users the Mau, is decreased, so that might in effect result in a higher unit price. So, I just wanted to call that out because again, that's something that's going to have to go through deal desk, go through, you know, whoever the powers that be are for approval. And I wouldn't be surprised, if that is marked up. So I just wanted to call that out. So.\nSpeaker ...2703: I mean, we should start with the base case, right? The base case being where we are today and then go from there. But, I think looking at the data, it's going to be pretty hard to see how the user count doesn't come down, right? The only question is how far does it come down, right? It's it's probably not going to be 600. Maybe it's somewhere closer to 500 or somewhere in between, or maybe it's closer to about two or 300, right? So, I don't know but let's start at the point that we all know which is where we are today, and we can tweak pricing from there.\nSpeaker ...9690: Awesome. Yeah, that sounds great. Well, yeah. Happy to get started on all this soon after this call here. And then we can, I think we can probably communicate on Monday along with some of the analytics feedback that Dan and Kelsey are going to prepare for you. If that sounds like an, OK plan.\nSpeaker ...2703: That's perfect. So we'll expect some feedback from you on pricing on Monday.\nSpeaker ...9690: Sure. And do you want to set up another meeting on the calendar? Should we wait until we have that?\nSpeaker ...8206: Put something on? I think it's a good idea to put something on. OK, yeah.\nSpeaker ...9690: A little bit nicer to go through. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...8206: We're all here now, we can figure out in a good time at the same time. Sam. I'm also going to be sending you a quick email just for some other housekeeping things about asking for, just if you can provide me with like a order form without commercials just so our legal team can review the current… terms that you have on there. And also… some other things such as our legal team has been asking for us to remove any auto renewals that's the request.\nSpeaker ...9690: Yep. That's I know we talked about that last week. Yeah, we did. OK. Yeah, especially since we're going to have a conversation probably every year anyway. So might as well just strike that. That's something I can do for you. OK. Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker ...8206: I'll send it on email just so I know because I don't think I sent the other one on email. I think we just talked about it maybe, but I'll just put it in writing real quick and we'll go from there. You can respond. OK, yeah.\nSpeaker ...9690: Perfect. Yeah. So in terms of another meeting, my calendar is fairly open next week. Afternoons would be great if that works with you any particular day, I could recommend maybe Tuesday or Wednesday?\nSpeaker ...8206: Yeah, either one's fine by me. Oh, wait. Let me see. Wait. This is next. Oh, no.\nSpeaker ...9690: Say like Wednesday at two that's OK?\nSpeaker ...8206: Yeah, that's good for me Wednesday.\nSpeaker ...2703: At two. Yeah, that works.\nSpeaker ...9690: OK. If we need to edit this, let me know. Happy to move things around.\nSpeaker ...8206: OK.\nSpeaker ...9690: Great. I will send this to you after this call… but, yeah, I'll take all this back to my team. We'll update you on Monday and we'll go from there.\nSpeaker ...8206: OK, fantastic. Appreciate it. Good. Thank you.\nSpeaker ...9690: Thanks. Both. Have a good weekend.\nSpeaker ...8206: Bye bye.",

Hello, Christopher. Hey, how's it going good, yourself? Good… mr. Rainey. Mr. Lamb?\nSpeaker ...6983: How's it going guys?\nSpeaker ...0500: Hello? Good.\nSpeaker ...6983: Eric, did I read this, right? That you're on the other side of the world right now?\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah, I.\nSpeaker ...6983: am, what time is it there?\nSpeaker ...4049: It is one a M.\nSpeaker ...6983: Oh, boy. We appreciate you.\nSpeaker ...4049: On the other side of the world… but gotta do what you gotta do.\nSpeaker ...6983: You're in Korea, right?\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...6983: Very jealous. It is. Seattle is like officially Seattle. We, today was our first today was our first day of like not just having the greatest weather like perfect fall, 60 degrees every day. I think it says on the forecast, 12 straight days of like 100 percent coverage of rain, so.\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah. All of a sudden, it goes from like a 14 hour days of sunshine to like six hours of sunshine. I know like overnight. Somehow, I know all of that says it's supposed to happen like a couple minutes every day, but it just happens.\nSpeaker ...6983: I was talking to Ryan Carson, who was here. We did one of the dinners, one of the cab dinners and he sent me a text and he was like, this is the greatest weather, Seattle's this is the best thing ever. Like, well, two days from now, you won't be singing the same song as soon as the rain comes.\nSpeaker ...4049: Ronnie, how are you?\nSpeaker ...0500: Doing well, Tom, how are you doing?\nSpeaker ...4049: Good, good.\nSpeaker ...0500: All right. So, we've got Chris on the call and did anybody else accept from our side? Tom? It's kind of weird like each one of us can only see our acceptance. We can't see what the rest have done.\nSpeaker ...4049: Oh, interesting. Yeah, there were a lot of forwards. Let's see Becky accepted.\nSpeaker ...0500: Okay, perfect.\nSpeaker ...4049: Ron and Russ came, did not accept. Okay, I thought I got a few other accepts.\nSpeaker ...0500: Chris, probably, Chris is on the call. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...4049: Chris is on.\nSpeaker ...0500: So, yeah, while we give while we give Becky me, Russ a minute to join Chris. Okay, I'll ping them, probably just lay out what we were thinking about for this call, Tom and then from an agenda perspective, and then we can kind of, you know, revise if needed and go from there. So I think I believe you've spoken to Becky a couple of weeks ago.\nSpeaker ...0500: So Becky and kaim are the account managers on the blackstone account. Becky's the account manager, kaim's like more of a client partner if you will overlooking blackstone and a couple of other accounts and what we thought we could do a few things. One is, of course, we had shared some names with you as to the stakeholders that we are involved with. But looks like there was no overlap which could be good because it would be good to see like other areas where you are involved with at blackstone and see if there are any collaboration opportunities. So that's one. And the second thing is that Russ, he so so nuevo which is a product that we built out for, the Aws partner demo competition. In fact, Chris was a key member of the team that built it out. Russ, sort of refactored it using amp. So we would want, we wanted to kind of just show it to you guys just to sort of show you tell you a bit about the product and as well as or maybe it's more of an accelerator versus a product and kind of, you know, show what we did with that. And then to kind of also get your thoughts on whether you think like these are other clients if not blackstone, where we can apply this to because blackstone is a good target for this. We just need to sort of, you know, figure out who do we speak to and how do we go about it. And then the last piece was that Chris is on the blackstone project and he is the one who used the Kodi tool to refactor or to accelerate his technical discovery process. And I think like Chris and gang, they prepared a case study which they also presented at the blackstone QBR. So we thought it would be good to sort of just.\nSpeaker ...0500: We thought it would be good to kind of give you guys just some, you know, oversight into or overview of what we did and what were the results we saw just to kind of get your thoughts and also get some views on how is it that we could use the tool better or anything around that? So yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking at a very high level. Does that sound good?\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah, I think that sounds great. I might suggest that we take that in reverse order because I think, you know, Kodi we're in right now and that will stimulate some ideas. And then definitely, I'm interested in how you guys have used amp and how we can showcase that within blackstone and elsewhere. And then I think we could use that to figure out where, you know, how we might show it to people that we're positioning, you know, amp to. And then we can think about that for blackstone and think about that, you know, kind of elsewhere. So I might say let's start with the Kodi case study and then we can look at the amp stuff that you guys have done with nuevo. And then we can think about kind of where to go.\nSpeaker ...0500: That's actually perfect. Yeah, that's perfect because Becky isn't here. So, you know, instead of waiting for her, we can do that and Chris is here, Chris, do you want to probably, you know, a couple of minutes, spend a couple of minutes on the case study on the Kodi case study, and then we go from there.\nSpeaker ...4049: Rainey and cam, does that work for you guys?\nSpeaker ...0379: Yeah, works great. We don't have slides or anything, but I can give you a high level overview basically. So we went into the project and we were dealing with a lot of legacy code and a lot of legacy SQL stuff. And some of these instances were running 2008 server and 2008 SQL. You know, obviously, that operating system is considerably aged out. So there was a bit of a skill gap we had and we essentially were able to use Kodi and sourcegraph to work with the information we could get from the systems, our current functional knowledge of powershell and backport it all to bat files and SQL connection strings that could be simplified to operate on a 2008 standard. We also use it to write a bunch of tests based on that output and generate test cases that would show SQL compatibility as well as build migration plans. And in the end, we ended up taking all the reports that were generated to our SQL queries and piping them back out. And then using Kodi to turn them into markdown and build out in a fairly extensive documentation library in a very user friendly way. So the acceleration process on the project was pretty massive and wide felt by the team. We were able to accomplish something that probably should have taken four months and roughly six weeks.\nSpeaker ...4049: And so with that, you guys were using, so blackstone gave you access to their Kodi licenses?\nSpeaker ...0379: Yes, that is.\nSpeaker ...4049: Correct. Yeah. Okay. Just out of curiosity, did they say we use doing time and materials? And they said this will make you go faster. How did that? How did that kind of work?\nSpeaker ...0379: No, it just kind of came about as a natural evolution of our work with them. They, they linked us up with their internal like. So we found out this existed, we asked for access to it much in the same way that would grant access to get a copilot. We were provisioned it. And then we designed sort of the patterns we use to leverage it and accelerate.\nSpeaker ...4049: That's cool. That's great. And what's have you guys? It sounds like you guys have done a QBR with blackstone where you talk about that. Are they like, did this resonate with them? Have they seen similar results on their own et cetera?\nSpeaker ...0379: We haven't done that sort of business evaluation with them. At this point. We're executing a multi phase contract and we're in between phases right now. So, I think once we complete the actual contract in its totality, there'll definitely be room for that sort of review. We, you know, have put into the roadmap, a fairly detailed retro of the experience not to highlight any negatives but to actually just take it as a learning experience. And, you know, show where we were able to execute with various tools. This will obviously come up and areas for improvement where we may have felt the tool gap.\nSpeaker ...4049: Got it. Okay. Interesting. Yeah, would love to see. I mean if you have two slides or anything in preparation for that, we'd be just, very curious on that and happy to support however we can, but that's impressive. I'm glad to hear that you guys have had such good success with Kodi.\nSpeaker ...0500: So we don't have slides on that, Tom, but there was a… there was a word doc that we have that was put together and I think they were like one or two pages in there that are relevant if you want. We can, I can pull up the word doc that I have, but yes, we don't have a case. We haven't prepared the case study yet.\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah, would love to see the word doc.\nSpeaker ...6983: Yeah, I was going to actually say, I think, that word doc, that word doc would be helpful. So, Cameron and I have, we've got a, like a biweekly sync with them on Wednesday of this week. And one of the topics that we want to bring up is obviously, they're using Kodi and they're using it in a really successful way and they're looking, you know, in this direction of like agentic behavior. And we're up against, you know, little old sourcegraph over here. We're running up. We're competing against anthropic for, that side of the business. And it's a, this is a long tail cell that we're going to be doing, but I think that this could be helpful and we could, you know, we could create even a slide on our side. This would be helpful to just talk about, yeah, like not only taking that success but what could that look like, you know, with a more agentic behavior? And so we can create this chronological order of, from nothing to something to nothing. Something else. I think it'd be super helpful.\nSpeaker ...0500: Okay. And, and we just wanted to talk a bit about that on the anthropic piece, Jonathan, but we can just talk for a bit. Yep. This is the, these are like kind of, the, this is what we presented to them at the QBR. So, some of this, Chris talked about the timeline efficiency where instead of like three to six month baseline, we brought down the discovery phase to six weeks, 60 percent reduction in manual analysis efforts with only two engineers, 40 percent improvement in issue identification, stakeholder alignment, coverage and risk reduction.\nSpeaker ...0500: Yep. And then, and then, yes, a bit of what were the technical best practices and methodologies employed? So, I wasn't part of the QBR or rather, I wasn't there when the QBR happened. So I don't know about what, I don't know about specific feedback on this, but I think overall, it was all very well received. The entire QBR went well. And I think what I heard was like, blackstone is kind of really interested in certain things that we talked about around AI and I think this was probably the key component of it. And, they probably, I think they said that we should have a follow up discussion because as you can imagine that QBR had a lot of the procurement guys, vendor guys, who may not necessarily sort of drive these initiatives. But if it's helpful, we could probably, snip out these two pages and send over to you.\nSpeaker ...6983: Yeah, I think it, yeah, I think it definitely would be helpful. I mean, cause it, you know, will be obviously, I think helpful for both parties. I think, you know, in our discussions with them, you know, us referencing these kprs, sorry, these KPIs with labfortynine, only continues to shine a great light on you all as well as the relationship that we have together?\nSpeaker ...4049: And, this may be a Becky question, but do y'all know Ronan? Do you know, who is the sort of lead, from blackstone and the QBR… who are the primary customers? Is that, is that the CIO that you're selling into?\nSpeaker ...0500: It's a Becky question. Okay. Yeah, yeah, that's yeah, I'm sorry. No.\nSpeaker ...4049: No, no, it's all good.\nSpeaker ...0500: What was the other one? Yeah. Did she?\nSpeaker ...6983: Share? Sorry, I don't and I don't mean to go off cuff here, but, I believe my gosh. I feel like when we had our last call, I, for some reason, I remember those names being mentioned.\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah, I, Ronan had sent over some names, that I'd sent, I think on the blackstone channel, and I don't think we recognized any of them. I didn't see any of them in, Salesforce. I think, we also had talked about a few names when we met Becky, which would have been, that we were merge. Yep.\nSpeaker ...6983: Yeah, I think that would just be, yeah, Tom, I was able to find that, but I think that'd be helpful to get any names from Becky cause we can do some name dropping on our side, cam and I can.\nSpeaker ...0500: Okay. Yeah, Becky. I think she had accepted the invite. She confirmed in a chat this morning. Let me just ping her.\nSpeaker ...0500: I think overall, Tom, you had mentioned that, none of those names rang a bell.\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah, and, I think even if they don't well, I mean, maybe we'll move on and look at the nuevo stuff, but I think even if they don't it's just useful for us to say, we understand this is being used, but if we can just, I think contextualize a little bit more, you know, beyond those names of, you know, contextualize where you guys, are working and I think we got some of that, but maybe tie that, into the names. Just so it's a natural sort of, cross referencing. I think that'll be, is rainy says here? I think that will be useful for both of us.\nSpeaker ...6983: I agree. I.\nSpeaker ...0500: Just pinged Becky. I'm sorry about this. She had, in a group internal chat this morning. She had said that she's attending.\nSpeaker ...4049: Well, maybe should we look at the nuevo stuff while we're kind of waiting for that?\nSpeaker ...0500: Yeah. So, I think Ross has a bit of a, his laptop is running some sort of an update, but give me a second. Ross, I just pinged over the video to you. I don't know if you can, it can even access it right now or not really.\nSpeaker ...0500: Ross, you're on mute. If you're trying to speak.\nSpeaker ...7390: Yeah, thank you. No, I can't, I'm on my phone at the moment. My laptop is doing a Microsoft update. I can't do anything with any Microsoft products.\nSpeaker ...0500: Fun times. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...6983: We've all been there, buddy. We've all been there.\nSpeaker ...0500: I pushed the update out to tomorrow. It prompted me this morning. And the last time I did an update, I literally could not use my laptop and had to go into work to get it sorted out. Okay? So, and Chris, you? Okay. Well, Chris isn't aware of what's been done. So, Ross, if I was to try and run the video, would you be able to kind of tell me where to go and talk through it? Or is that tough given that you are not on your phone?\nSpeaker ...7390: I can absolutely do it from my phone, no problem.\nSpeaker ...0500: Okay. Give me a second. Then let's see. Let me just try and give me a second guys. And meanwhile, Chris or Ross, if one of you can like ping Becky, I just pinged her, but if you can like ping her and ask if she's joining, that would be helpful.\nSpeaker ...7390: Will do.\nSpeaker ...0500: And I'm just pulling out the email I sent to you about, the stakeholders, maybe we can give me a second.\nSpeaker ...0500: Yeah. And so, Jonathan, what was your question on the stakeholders as to what area are we working with them in?\nSpeaker ...6983: Yeah, yeah, I think so, just kind of sharing what, my thoughts are here is, having those stakeholders. So, Cameron and I are meeting with, a few folks on the blackstone team next week that, subscribe to Cody, like they own the Cody relationship and they own the code search relationship. So that the part, the partnership between sourcegraph and them, and one of the topics that I think would be super helpful, you know, just even just not just name dropping but talking about, like, hey, one of our partners that we, you know, work with lab, they worked on this nuevo product with you guys or, you know, they did this huge code refactoring with Cody. So we're seeing success on different, you know, all around this relationship. Like is there any way, you know, you guys would want to speak with these people, get a referral? Like just trying to find more synergy, because again, like we're going to, you know, we're running up against the anthropic which is obviously a goliath in this space. And so, you know, the more data points that we have, can help us emphasize like the value proposition and the partnership.\nSpeaker ...0500: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And do you, or do you know which side are they leaning? Because I think, Tom had mentioned that amp, is not Aws native. It's on GCP and it seems like blackstone is all in on Aws. And I think anthropic is Aws native or Aws?\nSpeaker ...6983: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...0500: So, so, do you have a sense like, if that's going to be a deciding factor?\nSpeaker ...6983: You know, I don't like, I think that in Cameron, if you want to touch on this because you were on that last conversation, but I mean, my, I'll give you my perspective is, in this space, it's not one tool to rule them all like you've got a tool shed, you got to have a hammer and you got to have a screwdriver. And I think that, you know, there's always an opportunity whether there's competition in there or there isn't, you know, inevitably, they're probably going to use anthropic, then they're probably, you know, we're going to do a good job and we're going to get in there as well. So that's just my take. Yeah.\nSpeaker ...4591: I believe that too, and I think our primary contact and like I would say, champion, like, also believes that, he's very much playing like, the politics of it right now, right? Like blackrock gives 400,000,000 to anthropic. The business is going to use cloud code. With that being said, I think we got like a different tale of events, at least like a different, maybe, like more like leadership high level narrative from, you know, his boss, that's close with our CEO and, our head of revenue.\nSpeaker ...4591: And then they're also not going to start rolling out cloud code to users until Q1. But, you know, he's said like we anticipate using multiple tools next year. The thing is so, like, maybe we're in the same situation. It just went from like, you know, we were hoping to get some eyes on this sooner rather than later. And maybe this is, you know, Q1, Q2 for us next year, but, I think Rainey hit it, on the head, right? They're going to need multiple tools and I think their developers are already saying that, but right now, they're going to get a developer toolkit that includes, the take home bundle.\nSpeaker ...0500: Got it. Okay. So, on this, yeah.\nSpeaker ...7390: I'm sorry, just, I have one small point on that, topic. There's ample that amp provides that cloud code can't like just to put that out there, there's plenty of things that we can say about what amp can do and its capabilities and how user friendly it is that can't be said about your competitors just to put that out there? Like I've played with both sets of tools and I can honestly say that there's one I prefer over the others and that would be that'd be it.\nSpeaker ...6983: Yeah, really appreciate you saying that. And like that is a lot oftentimes the sentiment, that we will hear from users. And, yeah, I, I don't know how we can, get a quote from you on that or, you know, what we'll name drop you, but, yeah, I think that we're hearing similar sentiment.\nSpeaker ...4049: I think it's in the use of, or maybe it's you know, nuevo demo is the way to do that. If we can show that or reference that, and then use that as a jumping off point. So, here's, why, you know, amp was uniquely suited for this task.\nSpeaker ...0500: Yeah, we can do that. So, do we want to, you know, shift gears and discuss the piece that we had around? I think you guys had some questions, Jonathan, I forget if it was you or Cameron who mentioned about stakeholders and do we want to discuss that with Becky? Hopefully hopefully by the time that wraps up, Russ's laptop is functional again and we can look at nuevo versus me having to drive with video.\nSpeaker ...6983: Yeah, real quick. I just one follow up question or point that I wanted to direct at Russ. An idea that I do have is, you know, again, like how do we create synergy for both orgs? Like, how do we grow your guys' footprint? How do we grow our footprint? I do like this idea of like focusing on the nuevo product. I think what could be helpful is like we don't have like when on our call, with them on Wednesday, it's going to be very light. They're a great group, of individuals who we have a great relationship with. So, it's very loose. I'm kind of thinking about it and going into it and mentioning, and maybe even possibly having screenshot of the product if you guys feel comfortable. Obviously, you guys can block out whatever you guys need to. But having that as a backdrop to say, like our relationship here, clearly, you know, like there's value that they're bringing to you all we have this quote from and Russ, this is where I put you on a spot here. I have a quote from Russ who's building within these products that you guys are loving that his preference is, you know, amp and is, you know, and just building this center synergy where all things are leading towards growth on this product. I know it's a diatribe. So it maybe didn't make sense, but that's just kind of where my head's at.\nSpeaker ...0500: Yeah. So what we could do, Jonathan, like we have a case study on the nuevo product and I think like it also has, it also has some, what's the word? I'm looking for UI, UI, wireframes and things like that. And Russ correct me if I'm wrong. Essentially, what you did is like you sort of used the nuevo code, and basically used amp to sort of refactor the code and be like, hey, what does this part of the code do? What does that part of the code do? That was sort of in a sense what you did with amp, is that correct?\nSpeaker ...7390: Yeah. So, given, timeframes and constraints here. I'll try to keep this as quick as possible. What I showed off in the demo was everything from lighting up a new project from scratch, basically what you guys showed us, but kind of from a different lens to taking an existing live code base that had hackathon grade code and refactoring said hackathon grade code into something, much closer to production ready. I cut out all the processing time and everything like behind the scenes, but you see the prompts that go into it, you see the results, you see how it thinks you see using it from the perspective of, straight cli, to what it looks like in like VS code, plugin, et cetera, and how to iterate on those things. I threw in some impromptu stuff like, oh, hey, the user came back and asked me for this random thing that wasn't in spec. Like, how do we handle that? How can we do that? How do we, as a developer work with some of these AI tools? How do we interact with it? Because AI can't do all the work? It can do a lot of it just can't do all of it. So, how do we interact with that? How do we parse this et cetera? So, those are the types of things that I go through in the video and kind of show how it looks with an actual code base. Does that answer the question that was super.\nSpeaker ...6983: Helpful. No, that was super helpful for us.\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah, we want to see it though. So, how… do.\nSpeaker ...0500: you want to do it? Ross, do you want, is your laptop still out of commission?\nSpeaker ...7390: Well, the mac OS has decided to reboot so, it's going to be at least a couple of minutes, but if you want to show it, you can just fast forward to it to the nuevo part and just play it?\nSpeaker ...0500: Okay. I'll try this, I.\nSpeaker ...7390: Think, that starts at… 20.\nSpeaker ...4049: Well, so, is the whole video about amp, or is the video a broader topic?\nSpeaker ...7390: The whole thing's about amp.\nSpeaker ...4049: Oh, wow. Okay. Well, Ronnie.\nSpeaker ...7390: If you want, you can just send it over man. If they want to watch it, it's a long video. The whole thing is long. It's it's there's there, was it?\nSpeaker ...0500: Didn't work?\nSpeaker ...7390: There was, yeah, there, there's nothing brief about the video. It's pretty in depth.\nSpeaker ...0500: But, you know what, how about this? Let's, let's let, I'm able to load it. Okay. Let's get it to minute 20 because I think that is where. So, so Tom, the entire video is about amp, but I think minute 20 to minute, something is about nuevo.\nSpeaker ...0500: So that's probably of most interest. And, and if I try to play the audio through it, it's going to get messed up. So, maybe we can just have the video and Ross, you want to talk through it, does that work?\nSpeaker ...7390: Absolutely. I can absolutely do that.\nSpeaker ...0500: All right. Let me just fill this out. Guys. This is like, look at us. A bunch of folks can't get a video working but want to sell.\nSpeaker ...6983: If you, yeah, fly on the wall, we don't none of us work in tech.\nSpeaker ...7390: And the next portion?\nSpeaker ...0500: Yeah. And this was like, pretty much this was always the case when I was in blockchain and all of us are like on blockchain and rewiring financial infrastructure. And it's like, hey, wait, I can't share my screen because zoom's not letting me do.\nSpeaker ...6983: You.\nSpeaker ...0500: guys want to change the way DTCC settles trades, but you can't get zoom to work.\nSpeaker ...6983: Sounds about right?\nSpeaker ...0500: Yup. All right. Can you see my screen?\nSpeaker ...7390: Yup.\nSpeaker ...0500: Okay. So, Ross, I'll take your lead, buddy. You can, there's no voice over here. You go for it. I'll change that.\nSpeaker ...7390: So, the first section here, I have the, read me open and I'm trying to figure out what's going on with this repo. It's a large repo. There's a lot going on. I'm talking about how to get it installed a little bit, just go to the website. It's a couple of button clicks, et cetera. And sorry for my fat fingers in the video, but, massive, read me large code base, pretending like I don't really know what's going on. I just want a quick deep dive, a summary of a deep dive into what the heck is going on. So, I toss a prompt in here. None of this in the video is pre engineered, not this portion, the first half of the video, I scripted all of it, the second half, not so much. So you see here now, we've got a little summary of what's going on. It kind of goes through, I double check it. Everything looks pretty good. I talk a lot as I am ought to do, let's see where do we go? I think we go to a refactor, oh, no, we go to another explanation. Okay. That's what I'm doing. So, we're going to go and take a look at one of the larger, chunks of code the agents file in this, and we're going to ask it to explain what the heck is going on. And I do know a couple of times throughout this. And the reason why this is a little bit more free form than others than the first half rather is simply because if you ask it to do the same thing, twice even in different contexts because of how llms work. Obviously, it's going to process things slightly different. So, I don't have anything super prescriptive or overly scripted in these. So here, in a second, we're going to take a look at, what it looks like when you ask it to explain… in a minute. I guess I talk a lot faster on zoom than I did when I was recording. You can fast forward a little bit, Ronnie. There we go. Oh, yeah, this is perfect. Okay. So, this is something that you guys do that, your competitors don't is your tools will generate diagrams, which is, really nice. And the other thing that I would point out that you guys do that your competitors don't is your plugins are, very clean, with your competition, you have to use their terminal within your IDE, the pro to that is, it makes it a little bit more, functional for cross… IDE, work, but the downside. Is it's, very clunky when you're trying to use it like, your competitors products, they're very clunky because it always has to be terminal based.\nSpeaker ...6983: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...7390: All right. Here, I think we're doing a refactor. Yeah. So we're going to have it do a refactor now and kind of show off what that looks like to show. Okay, we can go from getting information, some explanation straight into this file's. Huge. There's too many things going on. You can clearly see that from the diagram your code produced, let's get it refactored. So, it goes through and it chews on that for a second… scroll back through. Talk about what it did show off the fact that you're showing diffs, I think in this segment, I actually talk about, your approval mechanism where, you ask permission to make changes and stuff like that. I'd given, the tool blanket permission to make whatever changes it wanted. So, I didn't end up actually being able to show that. I don't think, cause when I was kind of playing around with this, it would have, it… would have popped up. Okay. Yeah. Here, I'm actually showing off the fact that it corrects. So, it went through, it made code changes and then it made a mistake. And it went back, it looked, it found its mistake, it corrected the mistake, iterated on things. There's I might not have included the clip in this demo, but I actually showed off what happens if you tell it to do explicit testing, before and after each iteration, of change and it'll go through and do the testing and it kind of shows that off, that might not be in this segment, but I definitely have one somewhere on my laptop with that info.\nSpeaker ...6983: Yeah, Russ, I think that's actually, like talking about, I literally had this conversation with a customer yesterday, about or a user who has his entire team using amp, they put definitive guidelines in the agents MD file that, essentially tell the agent and the sub agents downline when basically like when to create the output and what to focus on. Because you mentioned something earlier that like, as you grow and grow like your context window gets so large that it's all being used as context and sometimes you don't want that. And so like, dude, I love everything you're showing us here like that's the exact way the approach, like I'm jacked up on this. This is awesome.\nSpeaker ...7390: In the, in the video itself, in, the language that I use, I do talk about context and I do mention, where you show the percentage context used and I try my best, maybe not as well as you folks could. But I try my best to explain context, how it works and when you're doing a task, be as detailed as you can, but keep each thread to one task. For this demo. What I was doing was so small that I could leave it all in one context because I'm not doing too much here by comparison to what the tool can do. I'm keeping it pretty limited, but I do talk about context making sure you're paying attention to it. And that's another thing that your competitors don't offer like, what is it called? They don't talk to you about context. They don't tell you what you're utilizing. They don't tell you how it works. There's no information on it. There's nothing in their documentation on it. You just need to have a reasonable understanding of how llms work and how agentic workflows function cause llms in and of themselves are stateless, right? Like by themselves, they're stateless. It's all about the agentic workflow and you have agents backing this. They retain state that's your context, right? So, people need to understand to wipe it. But you're the only folks that are talking about it and giving information to your users. Like I don't need to fully understand how your tool works to understand, okay, I'm 80 percent or it's giving me really weird answers. It's talking about stuff I said yesterday and I don't need that right now. Let's change it. You're yeah, that's one thing that I do mention in the video that I haven't talked about yet, but I do talk about that, in the demo for sure.\nSpeaker ...4049: Hey, Russ, what's the, who's the, when you made this video? Who's the audience?\nSpeaker ...7390: It was mostly internal to be Frank. It was to kind of show off the capabilities of what this toolkit can do for… everybody else here at lab. It was, meant to be a stepping stone to something that we could present to clients, hopefully presenting you folks as well. But, it was, this video, the first pass was a stepping stone to get some of our other devs to start pitching this to clients, maybe to even use it directly, but, ideally to pitch to clients and be like, hey, like this tool can accelerate everything you're doing. You should seriously consider it. And here is why.\nSpeaker ...0500: Yeah, yes, come to give you like a bit of background. We had an engineering town hall. I think it was about a month or so ago, and that's where Chris presented Cody or talked about Cody and how it helped them in the blackstone project. And, and before that is when Chris had sort of told us that, hey, here's this really cool tool. We should look into a partnership that's how you and I got talking. And Russ, Russ volunteer to sort of dig deep into amp. And, and yes, the idea is that, you know, he's of course, now comfortable with amp, he thinks that adds a lot of value and that's obviously important to have like that one technical champion if you will. And the audience right now is internal, but, but yeah, they were two objectives. One is to, of course, present it back to you and, you know, show that, hey, we understand, amp, we kind of sort of know what we are talking about when we play around with tools and sort of gain your confidence. Now, show this, and this is a piece that we have to work on a bit, like also show it internally to other technical architects or technical sales folks, if you will, for lack of a better word and encourage them to start thinking as to how they could use a tool like amp in their, in their client engagements and sort of, you know, Cody, amp, et cetera, use this to hasten up your discovery process, add efficiencies to the process, add efficiencies for the client? Yeah.\nSpeaker ...4049: Are you guys comfortable sharing the video with us?\nSpeaker ...0500: I think we could, if he can find out a way to do it because it's a couple of GB.\nSpeaker ...4049: Okay. You can just upload it to any of the drives, a Google drive, I think that works.\nSpeaker ...0500: Yeah. If,\nSpeaker ...7390: you, if you just Ronnie, if you're cool with us sharing it, if somebody just sends me a link, I can drop it. I.\nSpeaker ...0500: mean, there's nothing proprietary in there, right? Ross is just really new Evo, which, yeah. Okay, perfect. Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker ...7390: I mean, yeah, new Evo, is public information, so there's nothing proprietary.\nSpeaker ...0500: Exactly. So, so I think what we could do, and I know we only have a few minutes left. So, so what we were hoping for through this, Tom, Jonathan Cameron, is that, of course, you know, hopefully, you guys know, it gives you confidence that Ross knows what he's talking about and we have a fairly good grasp of the product, or he does. I shouldn't say we, it's all him at this point. So, come on.\nSpeaker ...4049: Ronnie, greater we.\nSpeaker ...0500: well, let's say he, because if this doesn't work, then we have one throat to choke. We win as a team, we lose as an individual.\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah.\nSpeaker ...0500: Yeah. So yeah. So we really wanted to, one, of course, show that to you. And second is, and this is where I think now that Becky's on the call, this could be useful. So, so nuevo to take a step back, it is basically AI for investment research. So today, like if I'm an investment, if, if I'm a research analyst, you know, anytime I need to research a stock, I obviously need to do a bunch of things. I need to go through the financials. I need to go through all the news and of course, in today's day and age, there's also, you know, like what if, what if portis would tweet that, hey, now, I'm going to issue a 200 percent tariff, on all, iphones that are imported from China. So, all of a sudden, what's that going to do to apple? So, so as an investment analyst, you have to do a lot of work today. And the idea of the nuevo tool is to take away the busy work from you. It's not to replace the research analyst, but it's like, you know, based on, internal notes, based on financial data, based on what's going on Twitter or something of that sort, we can give you a buy sell recommendation. We can help you draft a research note, but it's meant as an accelerator. And the idea is that if the research analyst, the busy work goes away, then they can research more tickers, they can be more efficient, you know, every, everything that is sort of the cornerstone of a good AI product. Yeah. And then going at that is that if you think about it, this is really applicable to any research firm. We've configured the workflow to appeal more to the buy side. So someone like blackstone, this is applicable to them. So there are two ways that we can think about this one is that, of course, Jonathan and Cameron, you guys have the relationship with blackstone and, you know, and with, we can probably use a few minutes to chat with Becky yesterday, who we talked to, who you talked to and see how we can progress this within the account. But more importantly, as you're talking to other research firms as you are talking to other. Yeah… other customers in this space to begin with, we would love this for you. We would love for this to be a part of your sales kit. So, you know, you kind of talking hypotheticals, how it could help, it could be like, hey, here's a product that was built out by our partner and this is how they are using amp. So, you know, use that as a way. To sort of, yeah, in advanced customers.\nSpeaker ...4049: Right. I think that's right? So, I think the talk track, so one, we'll take a look at the video and I think we'll probably have some comments but also just, it's going to get us excited. I mean, we like what we've seen on it so far. I think the second is using this with blackstone and just making sure that we, that we appropriately introduce it. And so I, we've got the voiceover, and we can talk. I think it will be good to just say, you know, we're talking to lab, we were developing them as a partner. We've had a great relationship. They've been investing in amp, you know, here's, kind of the use case, you should go talk to, go talk to Russ, go talk to Ronnie and Russ, and Becky. They're already engaged within your account. I think that's good for us. And then, yes, I think, you know, based upon, the, you know, based upon that traction. And the video, you know, you've actually got a couple of different functions represented on this call. And we can, you know, I think we will use this and I'm glad that this is an asset, but I want to, I want to see it. But I think it, is, this is an asset or something related to it will be an asset that we can use in other, you know, large financial services, organizations. So, yes, and absolutely, if that can get you guys in there, that's what we want to do. And I think you understand, yeah, the third party validation on the app, is very powerful for us. So, this, I think sets up quite well.\nSpeaker ...0500: And just on that, Tom, before we really want to give Becky and Jonathan a chance to talk to each other on that, Tom, of course, like, the reason why we did nuevo is because it was, it was already there. But if let's just say you say that, hey, you know, what hedge funds are a massive target for us? And we feel that if you were to pick up this investment management process, do something quick and dirty, we think that could help us land like we would love to get that insight from you as well, and see what we can do. Of course, as of now, Russ is on bench though, you know, that could change anytime, but at our end, what we are trying to do is like, you're not just create demos for the heck of it, this was created for Aws but, you know, like to your point, if you were to come and give us some insights that if you would be able to do this, we think we can position you well, we would be more than happy to create something that is sort of an ongoing asset for you.\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah. I mean, I'm sure, you know, existing code is, and that's why I like it that's an existing project, that you're working on because building something new is actually pretty easy and working with something existing, is much harder, but it's the real world.\nSpeaker ...0500: True. All right. So, yeah. So, okay, Jonathan, I know you're like.\nSpeaker ...6983: Yeah, I apologize. I got a job. Becky, I've got some contacts, that I'm going to share, we can just put them in the slack channel. Okay? And then if you can just like confirm these are folks and then add to it.\nSpeaker ...0500: Okay.\nSpeaker ...4591: That works.\nSpeaker ...6983: All right, guys. Sorry about that. I have to drop.\nSpeaker ...0500: And Cameron, everything from your side, you handle blackstone as well? Did I get that right? Yeah.\nSpeaker ...4591: I'm the account manager for blackstone. Yeah,\nSpeaker ...0500: And that's Becky on our side. So, I know we had sent some names over, but do you want to like quickly? I don't know if you guys always take a few minutes to talk about who you talked to at blackstone, what teams same at all?\nSpeaker ...4591: We need to drop here in a minute. To, I'll say, I didn't recognize any of the names on the list. I primarily work with, Amir and, there's another gentleman from Brazil that I work with, but we have a pretty small team, cause, on the search and Cody side of things. And, we did go on site with them with a larger audience to talk about amp, before it was, it before it was amp, like going back to, I think it actually might've been in January. So, I think at that point, it was just an idea, but we kind of showed like the future of like what we were thinking agentically. But no, I didn't know any of the names on the list that you had sent over.\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah, which departments are you talking to, if I could ask?\nSpeaker ...4591: Get you to the actual title work?\nSpeaker ...4049: And Cameron is our executive sponsor on the, has he been on the cat on the, yeah, on the cab?\nSpeaker ...4591: Monty? Yeah. Yeah. So, we primarily work with their dev ops org, and, Monty hall is, on our customer advisory board and his title, he's I mean, he's okay. So, he's their CTO. Yeah, I've never actually met with him. I've heard him on one call, but, he has a relationship with our CEO.\nSpeaker ...4049: Okay. Yeah, that's a familiar name.\nSpeaker ...0500: Okay. So, yeah, so, I guess, Cameron, you need to drop. So, Tom, I guess as, next steps, will you, we can send you that case study and that can happen over email and this video.\nSpeaker ...0500: We could find a way we can find a way to get it across to you. I'm not sure if you're on slack, Russ, but I'm not, but I can join and try to get across to Eric. But besides these two, pieces, yeah.\nSpeaker ...7390: I'm on slack. I'll send it over as soon as my computer is done throwing a temper tantrum.\nSpeaker ...0500: Okay, cool. And what do you suggest would be some next steps Tom?\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah. So, I think very specific. So, this group will all go watch that video, and I think that's going to give us ideas of where we can use it and also feedback on the video. And so, I think that's also going to give us context on how to introduce it. So, I think that's one thing is we'll just review the video and then provide some feedback on it. Then I think the second thing is it sounds like rainy, and, Cameron, blackstone meeting next week. And so, I think that it will make sense to introduce this concept into our group, our buyers, and we can give you more details, on those folks, via slack, but just, introduce that we're working with you guys and that you guys are having good success with amp, it'll give you some visibility, hopefully give us more credibility, on amp, and so, we'll do that, you know, we'll plan to do that, in next week's, meeting with them.\nSpeaker ...4049: And then the third thing is, you know, pending that success, and understanding the video, we'll mention this next week, I'll figure out what the, right, like what the right meeting is. But to some of our field based resources, I think they would do a meeting or we'll just do it tactically, in terms of getting a couple of other, reps, but let me think about how to do it. But what I want to do is, to figure out who our next accounts are, to be able to introduce this like introduce this in that's all sort of pending on, you know, we'll have to figure out we'll figure out the blackstone, exactly what the story is and, how we introduce it. I think it's pretty straightforward but I just want to like, we just need to think through what that is. Is it a side mention or is it a pretty slide or is it, you know, hey, go watch this video that's on YouTube, who knows, we'll have to like, we'll figure that out, but that's just kind of the flow that I, the flow that, I foresee but I think, our team will be hungry to use this in the, you know, in the financial services domain. So, I think we're pretty excited about this.\nSpeaker ...0500: Awesome. And, and probably a question on this, Tom, well, kind of related, but not so much, you mentioned that amp is GCP native. What does that mean for Aws customers like blackstone?\nSpeaker ...4049: Well… it depends a little bit. It's a little different for every customer. But generally, what it means is that since it's given that it's hosted, yeah, given that it's a hosted product, whether it's hosted on Aws or it's hosted on GCP, the customer or the prospect is going to want to understand our security controls because it's running within our workspace versus running in their workspace. So, Cody, for example, is running in the customer's Aws environment. And so, what it means generally is that their security teams are going to do a pretty thorough review, of what we're doing, and we've got, I don't know, soc two and all sorts of different certifications. We've got a security team. We've got a security portal. So, generally what it means is they're reviewing all that stuff, and then, you know, then approving it, but it's not, materially different from a review that they would do if it was being hosted on, hosted on Aws.\nSpeaker ...0500: Okay, cool. All right. Yes.\nSpeaker ...4049: There are people that say, oh, we want to run this, you know, we want to run this within our own environment, but then there become, very few, solutions which are available.\nSpeaker ...0500: Okay, cool. All right. So, so, I think Tom, like you and I can stay in touch over email. We'll of course, send over the information and then, let's see what we can, where we can go with this. But, yes, in general, I think, you know, for us, it's been like, really valuable to see amp in action, and, you know, thanks to Russ that he spent all this time understanding the product and like applying it really well. So, hopefully, that gives you some confidence, in our ability.\nSpeaker ...4049: Oh, it does absolutely, because, yes, it's easy for people to just look at it and say, yeah, I get it. But till you've dug in, and actually done something real. So it certainly appears, that Russ has been wrestling with, you know, a big code base, and using the tool effectively. So, yeah, that, that's fantastic to see.\nSpeaker ...0500: Awesome. Cool. So, we'll wait to hear back from you. And, of course, yeah, hopefully we can, both expand in blackstone and other places.\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah. It'd be awesome. Russ. If you have any trouble uploading that, let us know and we'll figure out what plan B is or plan C or plan? Yeah, we'll get it over, one way or another, hopefully not, with, without a usb drive.\nSpeaker ...7390: Carry, carry your pigeon, carry your pigeon.\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah. There we go. Yeah. And, may your laptop heal itself. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nSpeaker ...0500: That's a general piece of advice anytime you're doing a laptop update, only do it if you are either at the office or within reasonable commuting distance because this thing, it breaks more often than it works.\nSpeaker ...7390: Dude, I didn't even want to do it. It didn't give me a choice.\nSpeaker ...4049: I kept snoozing,\nSpeaker ...7390: it because I wanted to keep working. I was like, I was neck deep in a project and it was just like, nah, no more choices.\nSpeaker ...0500: The joy of working for a firm that sells to financial institutions.\nSpeaker ...7390: Yeah, it.\nSpeaker ...4049: Happens, Russ, for a lot of people. If you're a sales Guy, if that happened on Friday, it would be a sign that it was time to go play golf.\nSpeaker ...0500: Well, not if it's the last Friday of the month and you've got monthly accelerator bonuses or quarterly bonuses.\nSpeaker ...4049: There we go. Yeah, very true. Very true none.\nSpeaker ...0500: Of us work for oracle, so that's not the case right now.\nSpeaker ...4049: Yeah. All right. Yeah, Becky, Ronnie, Russ. Thank y'all this is exciting.\nSpeaker ...7390: Thanks. I appreciate it.\nSpeaker ...4049: Bye.",

That's a bold strategic move - and exactly the shift we're seeing at other high-growth companies.\n\nAmp is the enterprise AI coding assistant built for engineers who use AI *intelligently* - not just autocomplete. With 1M token context windows, GPT-5 powered architectural review (Oracle), and integration with your internal tools via MCP, Amp handles the complex work you described at re:Invent: microservices debugging, large-scale refactoring, and acquisition integration.\n\nGiven your recent MagicBrief acquisition and developer platform expansion, I'd love to show you how Amp can make your 626 engineers 3-5x faster on complex tasks.\n\nWorth 20 minutes?\"\n\n### Alternative Entry Points\n\n1. **Via Developer Platform Team**: \"You're building APIs for 300 apps. Want to ship faster with auto-generated tests and docs?\"\n2. **Via Engineering Directors**: \"Managing microservices complexity? Amp's large context helps engineers understand cross-service dependencies.\"\n3. **Via Recruiting/Talent**: \"You're hiring for AI tool competency. Shouldn't you equip your current team with enterprise AI coding tools?\"\n\n### Discovery Questions\n\n1. \"You changed interview assessments to test AI tool usage - what tools are your engineers currently using?\"\n2. \"How is the MagicBrief integration going? What's been most challenging about merging the codebases?\"\n3. \"Your developer platform hit 1B uses - what's the biggest bottleneck in shipping new APIs?\"\n4. \"You discussed microservices complexity at re:Invent - how do engineers currently debug cross-service issues?\"\n5. \"With 626 engineers across 5 locations, how do you maintain code consistency?\"\n\n---\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n### Objection: \"We already have GitHub Copilot\"\n\n**Response**: \n\"Copilot is excellent for line-level completions - keep using it. Amp complements Copilot for architecture-level work:\n- Understanding dependencies across your microservices (1M token context)\n- Reviewing complex refactoring plans before execution (Oracle with GPT-5)\n- Integrating acquired codebases like MagicBrief (Finder + large context)\n- Making consistent changes across multiple services (subagents)\n\nThink of Copilot as autocomplete, Amp as your senior engineer pair programmer. Your CTO wants engineers who use AI tools *intelligently* - that means knowing when you need deep reasoning and large context, not just autocomplete.\"\n\n### Objection: \"Our engineers are already very productive\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"Absolutely - 240M users and $2.7B revenue prove it. But your CTO is explicitly hiring for engineers who can use AI tools to be 3-5x more productive. That's the strategic bet: already-great engineers become exceptional with the right AI tools. Amp is the enterprise tool that delivers on that vision with security, scale, and SOC 2 compliance.\"\n\n### Objection: \"We build our own internal tools\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"That's impressive - your experimentation platform is a great example. Amp actually accelerates building *more* internal tools. Plus, Amp integrates with your internal tools via MCP, so your engineers can access Canva-specific workflows right in their coding assistant. The teams who built your experimentation platform could build the next one 3x faster with Amp.\"\n\n### Objection: \"We need to see ROI\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"Fair. Typical Amp customers see:\n- 3-5x faster on complex tasks (refactoring, debugging, integration)\n- 50% faster onboarding for new engineers\n- Fewer production bugs from better testing and code review\n\nWith 626 engineers, even a 20% productivity gain is 125 full-time engineers worth of output. At your engineer cost (~$200K loaded), that's $25M annual value. Amp pays for itself in the first month.\n\nWant to pilot with your developer platform team or AI features team first?\"\n"

With Copilot, you'd get code suggestions but still manually wire up tests, docs, validation. Amp understands your entire development workflow.\"\n\n## Pilot Options\n\n### **Pilot Option 1: Developer Platform Team (2-4 weeks)**\n\n**Target Team**: API development team building Content Query, Design Editing, Tables APIs\n\n**Objectives**:\n- Accelerate API endpoint development by 30%+\n- Reduce time from API design to tested implementation\n- Improve API documentation consistency\n\n**Success Metrics**:\n- API endpoints shipped per sprint\n- Time to implement new endpoint (design → tested code)\n- Developer satisfaction scores\n- Code review cycle time reduction\n\n**Rollout**:\n1. **Week 1**: Onboard 3-5 senior engineers with AGENTS.md setup\n2. **Week 2**: Expand to 10 engineers, measure baseline metrics\n3. **Week 3-4**: Full team usage, collect feedback, iterate on AGENTS.md conventions\n\n**Why This Team**:\n- High-impact work: developer platform affects 300+ external apps\n- Clear metrics: API development has measurable velocity\n- Pattern-heavy work: APIs follow conventions - perfect for AI code generation\n- Brendan Humphreys (CTO) closely involved with platform strategy\n\n**Integration Points**:\n- Connect Amp to Canva's MCP server for internal tool access\n- Configure AGENTS.md with API development standards\n- Set up JetBrains/VS Code integrations for team's preferred IDEs\n\n### **Pilot Option 2: Experimentation Platform Team (2-4 weeks)**\n\n**Target Team**: Team maintaining in-house experimentation platform\n\n**Objectives**:\n- Accelerate platform feature development\n- Improve code quality for self-service features\n- Reduce technical debt accumulation\n\n**Success Metrics**:\n- Feature delivery velocity (self-service capabilities shipped)\n- Reduction in data scientist support requests\n- Code review approval time\n- Test coverage improvements\n\n**Rollout**:\n1. **Week 1**: Onboard 2-3 platform engineers\n2. **Week 2**: Use Amp for one complete feature (e.g., new experiment type)\n3. **Week 3-4**: Expand to broader team, tackle technical debt backlog\n\n**Why This Team**:\n- Strategic priority: democratizing experimentation is a stated goal ([Canva Engineering Blog](https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/how-we-build-experiments-in-house/), 2024-06-27)\n- Complex internal tooling: perfect use case for Oracle's architectural guidance\n- Python/Django stack: Amp excels with Python\n- Clear \"before/after\": currently bottlenecked by data scientists\n\n**Integration Points**:\n- Configure Python/Django specific AGENTS.md rules\n- Set up Oracle for architectural reviews of new platform features\n- Use subagents for parallel work on frontend/backend/data layer\n\n## Recommended Approach\n\n**Start with Pilot Option 1 (Developer Platform Team)** because:\n\n1. **CTO visibility**: Platform work is strategic, Brendan Humphreys will see impact directly\n2. **External multiplier**: Improvements affect 300 apps, 122 countries of developers\n3. **Measurable impact**: API velocity is quantifiable\n4. **Proof point for rollout**: Success here justifies expanding to all 626 engineers\n\n**Expansion path after pilot**:\n1. Developer Platform Team (pilot) → 3-5 engineers\n2. Experimentation Platform Team → 5-10 engineers  \n3. AI Integration Teams (Leonardo.Ai, MagicBrief) → 20-30 engineers\n4. Microservices Infrastructure Teams → 50-100 engineers\n5. Full Engineering Organization → 626 engineers\n\n## Key Objections and Responses\n\n### \"We already use GitHub Copilot across the team\"\n\n**Response**: \"Copilot is great for line-level completions. But you're working at a different scale now - 1.2M requests/day across microservices, integrating AI acquisitions, managing a developer platform with 1B uses. You need a tool that understands your entire architecture, not just the next line. That's what Amp's 1M token context and Oracle provide. Think of Amp as your senior engineer pair programming, while Copilot is autocomplete.\"\n\n### \"How is this different from Cursor?\"\n\n**Response**: \"Three critical differences for Canva:\n1. **Scale**: Amp's context windows are 5-10x larger - essential for your microservices complexity\n2. **Reasoning**: Oracle gives you GPT-5 architectural guidance, not just code generation\n3. **Extensibility**: MCP integration means Amp works with your internal tools - you already publish an MCP server, so this is a natural fit\n\nCursor is excellent for smaller codebases. At 626 engineers and your architectural complexity, you need Amp's capabilities.\"\n\n### \"AI tools hallucinate and produce buggy code\"\n\n**Response**: \"Valid concern. That's why Amp has:\n1. **AGENTS.md**: Your conventions become enforceable rules, not suggestions\n2. **Oracle review mode**: GPT-5 reviews code before it goes out\n3. **Lint/test integration**: Amp runs your existing quality checks automatically\n4. **Tool permissions**: You control exactly what Amp can do\n\nYou told Fortune you want engineers who use AI 'intelligently' - Amp's design embodies that intelligence through guardrails and oversight.\"\n\n### \"This will replace our engineers\"\n\n**Response**: \"Brendan said it perfectly in his Fortune interview - you're looking for engineers who work intelligently WITH AI tools. Amp makes your 626 engineers more effective, not redundant. They spend time on architecture, product decisions, complex debugging - the high-value work. Amp handles the mechanical coding. You're shipping more features with the same team, not fewer features with fewer people.\"\n\n## Pricing Context\n\n**Canva's Scale**: 626 engineers\n\n**Amp Enterprise Pricing** ([Amp Manual](https://ampcode.com/manual#pricing)):\n- SSO integration\n- Zero data retention option (critical for Canva's IP)\n- Managed org-wide settings\n- Pooled billing\n- Team workspaces\n\n**Estimated Investment**: ~$50-60/engineer/month for 626 seats = ~$375K-450K annually\n\n**ROI Calculation**:\n- **30% productivity gain** (conservative) × 626 engineers = 188 engineer-equivalents\n- At $150K loaded cost/engineer = **$28M annual value**\n- **ROI: 62-75x**\n\n**Comparable Investments**: Canva spent $22.5M on MagicBrief acquisition ([Forbes Australia](https://www.forbes.com.au/news/innovation/canva-to-acquire-australian-ai-platform-magicbrief/), 2025-06-18). Amp delivers similar strategic value for 2% of that cost.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Technical deep-dive**: Brendan Humphreys + VP Engineering (30 min)\n2. **Pilot planning**: Identify Developer Platform team lead, scope first sprint\n3. **AGENTS.md workshop**: Work with team to encode Canva's conventions (1 hour)\n4. **Pilot kickoff**: Onboard 3-5 engineers, begin metrics collection\n5. **Week 2 check-in**: Review metrics, adjust approach\n6. **Week 4 results review**: Present data to leadership, plan rollout\n\n---\n\n**Key Insight**: Canva is explicitly preparing for an AI-augmented engineering culture (Fortune interview). They're evaluating tools NOW. First mover advantage goes to the vendor who demonstrates the most sophisticated AI partnership - that's Amp's Oracle + context + extensibility story."

I'm [Name] from Amp, an AI coding assistant built by Sourcegraph. I saw your Fortune interview where you mentioned changing engineering assessments to evaluate how candidates work with AI tools - that really resonated because it's exactly the problem we solve: helping engineers work *intelligently* with AI, not just use autocomplete.\n\nI also caught your AWS re:Invent talk about managing complexity at scale. With 626 engineers handling 1.2 million requests a day across microservices, you're dealing with a level of architectural complexity that most AI coding tools weren't designed for. That's why I wanted to connect.\n\nBefore I share what we do, I'd love to understand your current setup better.\"\n\n### Positioning Statement\n\n**If asked \"What does Amp do?\"**:\n\n\"Amp is an AI coding assistant, but designed for engineering teams at scale. While tools like Copilot focus on code completion, we're built for the complexity you're dealing with - massive codebases, microservices architectures, distributed teams. We can hold up to a million tokens of context in working memory, so we actually understand your full system architecture, not just the file you're editing.\n\nThink of it as having a senior engineer who's read your entire codebase pair programming with you, rather than an autocomplete tool.\n\nBut let me pause there - what are you using today for AI coding assistance?\"\n\n## Discovery Questions (20-25 minutes)\n\n### Section 1: Current State Assessment\n\n#### **Q1: AI Tool Adoption**\n\n**Question**: \"What AI coding tools are your engineers currently using? Are you standardized on anything, or is it more of a 'bring your own tool' situation?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- GitHub Copilot (most likely)\n- Cursor, Windsurf, other tools\n- Adoption rate (all engineers? subset?)\n- Satisfaction level (\"it's fine\" vs \"they love it\")\n\n**Follow-up based on response**:\n\n*If using Copilot*: \"Got it. What's working well with Copilot? And where do you find engineers still hitting friction?\"\n\n*If no standard tool*: \"Interesting - what's driving the 'bring your own tool' approach? Is it that nothing has met the bar, or is it more about letting engineers choose their workflow?\"\n\n*If using Cursor*: \"Cursor's great for smaller projects. How's it handling your microservices complexity - can engineers navigate across services effectively?\"\n\n**Trap to avoid**: Don't bash their current tools. Position Amp as complementary or next-generation.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q2: Scale and Complexity Challenges**\n\n**Question**: \"You mentioned in your re:Invent talk that you evolved from a monolith to microservices. When engineers need to make changes that span multiple services - like adding a new feature that touches 5-6 services - how do they approach that today?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Manual context switching between repos/files\n- Losing track of dependencies\n- Long debugging cycles\n- Tribal knowledge (\"only Sarah understands how these services talk\")\n\n**Follow-up**: \"Do your AI tools help with that multi-service navigation, or are engineers basically doing that manually?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: Whether their current tools handle their architectural complexity. If they say \"mostly manual,\" that's Amp's 1M token context opportunity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q3: Developer Platform and API Development**\n\n**Question**: \"Your developer platform hit a billion app uses - congrats on that milestone. For the team building those APIs - Content Query, Design Editing, Tables - what does their development workflow look like? What's the bottleneck in getting new endpoints shipped?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Spec → implementation → testing cycle time\n- Code review delays\n- Documentation debt\n- Consistency challenges (\"each engineer writes APIs slightly differently\")\n\n**Follow-up**: \"How much of that work is genuinely creative versus 'we've done this pattern 50 times, but it's still manual'?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: Potential pilot team and use case. If they mention repetitive patterns, that's Amp's strength.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q4: AI Feature Integration (Leonardo.Ai, MagicBrief)**\n\n**Question**: \"You acquired Leonardo.Ai and MagicBrief to accelerate AI capabilities. How's the integration work going? What's the engineering challenge there - is it more about understanding their codebases, refactoring to fit your architecture, or something else?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Onboarding acquired teams' code\n- Architectural mismatches\n- Technical debt from acquisitions\n- Speed of integration (\"slower than we'd like\")\n\n**Follow-up**: \"When you bring in a new codebase like Leonardo's, how long does it take engineers to get productive? Can they navigate it easily or is there a ramp-up period?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: Whether Amp's Librarian (cross-repo research) and Oracle (architectural guidance) solve real pain.\n\n---\n\n### Section 2: Engineering Culture and AI Strategy\n\n#### **Q5: AI Tool Competency in Hiring**\n\n**Question**: \"In your Fortune interview, you mentioned changing engineering assessments to evaluate how candidates use AI tools. What does 'working intelligently with AI' look like in practice at Canva? What are you testing for?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Specific skills (e.g., prompt engineering, knowing when NOT to use AI)\n- Quality bar (\"we want engineers who review AI output critically\")\n- Strategic vs tactical use of AI\n\n**Follow-up**: \"Do your current AI tools support that 'intelligent use' model, or is it more on the engineer to figure out the right workflow?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: Whether Canva wants opinionated, intelligent AI tools (Amp with Oracle/AGENTS.md) or just raw code generation.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q6: Code Quality and Standards at Scale**\n\n**Question**: \"With 626 engineers across Sydney, Manila, London, Austin, Beijing - how do you maintain code quality and consistency? Are there specific conventions or patterns you want engineers to follow?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Style guides, linters, code review standards\n- Challenges with enforcement (\"we have guidelines but they're not always followed\")\n- Onboarding new engineers to conventions\n- Language/framework-specific patterns\n\n**Follow-up**: \"When you use AI tools to generate code, does the output match those conventions automatically, or do engineers have to manually adjust it?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: AGENTS.md opportunity. If they have conventions but AI tools ignore them, Amp solves that.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q7: Experimentation Platform Roadmap**\n\n**Question**: \"I read your engineering blog about building the experimentation platform in-house. You mentioned wanting to reduce data scientist bottlenecks and enable self-service. What's the next phase for that platform?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- New features planned\n- Technical debt to address\n- Adoption challenges (\"teams still ask data scientists for help\")\n- Platform team size and velocity\n\n**Follow-up**: \"What's the constraint on platform development velocity right now - is it ideas, engineering capacity, or something else?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: Potential pilot team (experimentation platform). If velocity is constrained by engineering capacity, Amp helps.\n\n---\n\n### Section 3: Pain Point Deep-Dive\n\n#### **Q8: Biggest Developer Productivity Challenge**\n\n**Question**: \"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one developer productivity challenge at Canva, what would it be?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Context switching between services\n- Code review cycle times\n- Onboarding new engineers\n- Technical debt accumulation\n- Test writing / maintenance\n- Documentation drift\n\n**Follow-up**: \"What have you tried so far to address that? What worked, what didn't?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: The clearest ROI case for Amp. Focus demo on this pain point.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q9: AI Tool Limitations**\n\n**Question**: \"What are the current limitations of the AI coding tools your team uses? Where do engineers hit a wall and have to fall back to manual work?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Small context windows (\"can't see the full picture\")\n- Hallucinations / buggy code\n- Can't navigate complex architectures\n- No architectural guidance, just code generation\n- Doesn't follow Canva's conventions\n\n**Follow-up**: \"If those limitations were solved, what would that unlock for your team?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: Direct competitive positioning. Map their limitations to Amp's strengths.\n\n---\n\n### Section 4: Buying Process and Decision Criteria\n\n#### **Q10: Decision Process for Developer Tools**\n\n**Question**: \"When you evaluate new developer tools, what's the process? Is it bottom-up (engineers try it and advocate), top-down (you make a strategic call), or something in between?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Pilot approach (\"we usually pilot with one team\")\n- Key stakeholders (CTO, VP Eng, Engineering Directors)\n- Timeline (\"we can move fast\" vs \"we have a yearly planning cycle\")\n- Budget authority\n\n**Follow-up**: \"If we were to run a pilot, which team would be the best fit? Developer Platform, AI Integration, Infrastructure?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: How to structure the pilot proposal and who needs to be involved.\n\n---\n\n#### **Q11: Success Criteria**\n\n**Question**: \"If we ran a 4-week pilot with one of your teams, what would success look like? What metrics would you want to see?\"\n\n**Listen for**:\n- Velocity (PRs shipped, features completed)\n- Quality (code review feedback, bug rates)\n- Developer satisfaction (\"engineers want to keep using it\")\n- Time savings (\"30% faster\" or specific tasks)\n\n**Follow-up**: \"What would make you say 'this is worth rolling out to all 626 engineers'?\"\n\n**What this reveals**: How to design the pilot and measure success.\n\n---\n\n## Demo Storyline (15-20 minutes)\n\n### Demo Structure\n\n**Don't do a feature tour.** Show solutions to THEIR pain points discovered in Q8-Q9.\n\n**Structure**:\n1. Quick context: \"Based on what you shared, I want to show you how Amp handles [specific pain point].\"\n2. Live demo: Real coding scenario matching their architecture\n3. Contrast: \"Here's how you'd do this with Copilot/Cursor\" vs \"Here's Amp\"\n4. Impact: \"This would save your engineers X hours per week\"\n\n### Demo Scenario A: Microservices Debugging\n\n**Use when**: They mentioned challenges navigating across services\n\n**Setup**:\n\"You mentioned engineers struggle when debugging issues that span multiple services. Let me show you how Amp handles that.\n\nI'm going to simulate a bug in a payment processing flow that touches your API gateway, payment service, and notification service. Watch how Amp keeps all three services in context simultaneously.\"\n\n**Steps**:\n1. **Librarian**: Search across 3 service repos to find related code\n2. **Context loading**: Load 10+ files (40K+ lines) into Amp's context\n3. **Oracle**: Ask \"Why would a payment succeed but no notification send?\" - Oracle analyzes all services and identifies race condition\n4. **Multi-service fix**: Edit 3 files across 2 services in one operation\n5. **Tests**: Generate integration tests that cover the cross-service scenario\n\n**Contrast**:\n\"With Copilot, you'd be context-switching between repos, manually connecting the dots, losing your mental model. Copilot can suggest the next line, but it can't see the race condition across services. Amp holds the full architecture in memory.\"\n\n**Impact**:\n\"Your engineers told me debugging cross-service issues takes hours. This took 4 minutes. Multiply that across 626 engineers and hundreds of services.\"\n\n---\n\n### Demo Scenario B: API Development (Developer Platform)\n\n**Use when**: They mentioned repetitive API work or developer platform challenges\n\n**Setup**:\n\"Your Content Query API team ships new endpoints regularly. Let me show you how Amp accelerates that workflow while maintaining your conventions.\"\n\n**Steps**:\n1. **AGENTS.md setup**: Show Canva's API conventions encoded (auth patterns, error handling, validation)\n2. **Generate endpoint**: \"Add a /designs/search endpoint with filters for tags, date range, author\"\n3. **Watch Amp**:\n   - Read existing API patterns from codebase\n   - Generate endpoint following exact conventions\n   - Write OpenAPI spec\n   - Add validation logic\n   - Generate tests matching existing test patterns\n   - Update documentation\n4. **Run checks**: `npm run lint && npm run typecheck` - everything passes\n\n**Contrast**:\n\"With Copilot, you get code suggestions, but YOU wire up the tests, docs, validation manually. And Copilot doesn't know your conventions - you're fixing style issues in code review. Amp generates everything, following your standards automatically.\"\n\n**Impact**:\n\"Your Developer Platform team told me new endpoints take 2-3 days from spec to reviewed code. Amp gets you to reviewable code in 15 minutes. That's 10x faster API development.\"\n\n---\n\n### Demo Scenario C: AI Feature Integration\n\n**Use when**: They mentioned Leonardo.Ai or MagicBrief integration challenges\n\n**Setup**:\n\"Integrating Leonardo.Ai means connecting their image generation models to your existing design pipeline. Let me show you how Amp helps navigate unfamiliar codebases.\"\n\n**Steps**:\n1. **Librarian**: Search Leonardo.Ai's GitHub repos (or simulated internal repos) to understand their API patterns\n2. **Read patterns**: Amp reads their authentication, rate limiting, error handling\n3. **Parallel subagents**:\n   - Agent 1: Build API client for Leonardo's endpoints\n   - Agent 2: Add TypeScript types for their models\n   - Agent 3: Write integration tests with mocked responses\n   - Agent 4: Update documentation\n4. **Oracle review**: \"Review this integration for security issues, rate limit handling, and error cases\"\n5. **Oracle response**: Identifies missing retry logic, suggests circuit breaker pattern\n6. **Apply fixes**: Amp implements Oracle's recommendations\n\n**Contrast**:\n\"Manual approach: Engineers spend days reading Leonardo's docs, trial-and-error API calls, back-and-forth with their team. Copilot can't help because it doesn't know Leonardo's codebase. Amp's Librarian reads their code, understands their patterns, generates correct integration code first try.\"\n\n**Impact**:\n\"You acquired MagicBrief for $22.5M to accelerate creative intelligence. Every week spent on integration is delayed ROI. Amp collapses weeks of integration work into days.\"\n\n---\n\n### Demo Scenario D: Experimentation Platform Feature\n\n**Use when**: They mentioned experimentation platform as a priority\n\n**Setup**:\n\"Your blog post mentioned wanting to reduce data scientist bottlenecks. Let's add a self-service feature: a UI for non-technical users to create A/B tests without writing Python.\"\n\n**Steps**:\n1. **Read existing platform code**: Django models, experiment configs\n2. **Generate feature**:\n   - Frontend: React form for experiment setup\n   - Backend: Django API endpoint to validate and create experiment\n   - Validation: Business logic to prevent invalid configs\n   - Tests: Unit and integration tests\n3. **Oracle architectural review**: \"Is this approach scalable? Any edge cases?\"\n4. **Oracle feedback**: Suggests adding experiment preview mode, rate limiting for API\n5. **Implement suggestions**: Amp adds preview mode and rate limiting\n\n**Contrast**:\n\"This feature would normally take a sprint: frontend engineer builds UI, backend engineer builds API, data scientist validates logic, tests written separately. Amp delivers the complete feature in one sitting.\"\n\n**Impact**:\n\"Your goal is democratizing experiments. Amp democratizes platform development - your small platform team can ship features as fast as your product teams need them.\"\n\n---\n\n## Handling Objections\n\n### Objection 1: \"We're happy with GitHub Copilot\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"That's great - Copilot is excellent at line-level completions. Here's the question: when your engineers debug issues across microservices, or integrate acquired codebases like Leonardo.Ai, does Copilot give them the full architectural picture, or are they manually connecting the dots?\n\nAmp and Copilot solve different problems. Copilot autocompletes the next line. Amp understands your entire system architecture. Many of our customers use both - Copilot for quick completions, Amp for complex multi-file work.\n\nIf you're open to it, we could run a small pilot with your Developer Platform team for 2 weeks. If it's not meaningfully better than Copilot for their workflow, you lose nothing. But if it 2x's their API development velocity, that's worth knowing.\"\n\n---\n\n### Objection 2: \"AI tools hallucinate and create buggy code\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"Absolutely valid concern. That's why Amp has guardrails:\n\n1. **AGENTS.md**: You encode your conventions - linting rules, test patterns, security requirements. Amp follows them automatically.\n2. **Oracle review mode**: Before code ships, Oracle (GPT-5) reviews it for bugs, security issues, edge cases. It's like having a senior engineer peer review every AI suggestion.\n3. **Tool permissions**: You control exactly what Amp can execute - block bash commands, require approval for certain operations.\n4. **Integration with your checks**: Amp runs your existing linters, type checkers, tests. If something fails, Amp sees the error and fixes it.\n\nIn your Fortune interview, you said you want engineers who work 'intelligently' with AI. These guardrails ARE that intelligence - they prevent the hallucination problem you're worried about.\n\nWould you be open to seeing how AGENTS.md works for Canva's specific conventions?\"\n\n---\n\n### Objection 3: \"We're not ready to evaluate new tools right now\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"I totally understand - timing matters. Two questions:\n\n1. When would be the right time to revisit this? Q1 planning? After your next release?\n2. Is there a specific trigger that would make this a priority - like a new initiative, team scaling, or a productivity challenge that becomes urgent?\n\nThe reason I ask: you mentioned in your re:Invent talk that managing complexity at scale is a key focus. If that challenge gets worse before we talk again, I'd hate for your team to struggle when there's a solution available.\n\nHow about this: I'll send over a one-pager specific to Canva - your architecture, your pain points, exactly how Amp would help. You keep it on file, and when timing is right, you have the context ready. Does that work?\"\n\n---\n\n### Objection 4: \"What about security and IP protection?\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"Critical question for a company like Canva with proprietary design algorithms and AI models. Amp Enterprise has zero data retention - your code never leaves your control, we don't train models on it, nothing is stored.\n\nYou also get:\n- **SSO integration** for access control\n- **Audit logs** for compliance\n- **On-premise deployment options** if you want Amp running in your VPC\n- **Tool permissions** to block any operations you consider risky\n\nGiven your AWS partnership and the sensitivity of Leonardo.Ai's models, I'd recommend we do a security review session with your infosec team before any pilot. Would that address your concerns?\"\n\n---\n\n## Closing (5 minutes)\n\n### Summary\n\n**Talk Track**:\n\"Brendan, here's what I heard:\n\n1. [Pain point 1 from Q8] - which is costing your team [estimated impact]\n2. [Pain point 2 from Q9] - where your current tools hit limitations\n3. You're explicitly looking for engineers who work intelligently with AI tools - which is exactly what Amp is designed for\n\nBased on that, I think there's a strong fit, specifically for [Developer Platform team / Experimentation Platform team / other]. \n\nHere's what I'd propose...\"\n\n---\n\n### Proposed Next Steps\n\n**Option A: Fast-Track Pilot (if high interest)**\n\n\"Let's run a 2-week pilot with your [specific team]. I'll work with [team lead name if mentioned] to:\n\n1. Set up AGENTS.md with your conventions (1-hour workshop)\n2. Onboard 3-5 engineers (they keep using their current tools in parallel)\n3. Track velocity metrics you care about: [specific metrics from Q11]\n4. Week 2 review: If it's not a clear win, you're out nothing but 2 weeks. If it is, we discuss rolling out to more teams.\n\nI can get you set up by [next week]. Does that timeline work?\"\n\n---\n\n**Option B: Technical Deep-Dive (if needs more info)**\n\n\"I'd love to do a deeper technical session with you and [VP Engineering / Engineering Directors] to show:\n\n1. How Amp would handle [specific pain point]\n2. AGENTS.md setup for Canva's conventions\n3. Oracle in action for architectural guidance\n4. Answer any technical questions your team has\n\n30-45 minutes, and we'll leave time for Q&A. Would [specific date/time] work?\"\n\n---\n\n**Option C: Async Evaluation (if timing is off)**\n\n\"I'll put together a Canva-specific evaluation guide:\n\n1. Your architecture (microservices, developer platform, AI integrations)\n2. Specific pain points we discussed\n3. How Amp solves each one (with demo videos)\n4. Proposed pilot plan when you're ready\n\nYou can share it internally with your team, and when timing is right, we'll reconnect. I'll send that over by [this week]. Sound good?\"\n\n---\n\n### Calendar Hold\n\n**Talk Track**:\n\"Let me send a calendar invite for [next step] while we're on the call. What email should I use?\"\n\n**Action**: Send invite DURING the call if possible. Conversion drops 50% if you wait.\n\n---\n\n## Post-Call Follow-Up\n\n### Email Template (within 2 hours)\n\n**Subject**: \"Canva + Amp: [Pain Point] Solution | Next Steps\"\n\n**Body**:\n\n---\n\nBrendan,\n\nGreat talking today.
