## Analysis Guidelines

### 1. Talk Ratio
- **Ideal discovery calls**: 30% rep, 70% customer
- **Ideal demos**: 50% rep, 50% customer
- Assess if rep is listening vs talking too much
- Note: Silence and pauses are good - let customer think

### 2. Technical Depth
- **Excellent**: Confidently answers technical questions, uses appropriate depth for audience
- **Good**: Answers most questions, occasionally needs to follow up
- **Needs improvement**: Struggles with technical questions, misses technical selling opportunities

### 3. Objection Handling
Rate each objection response:
- **Excellent**: Acknowledges concern, provides specific evidence, advances conversation
- **Good**: Addresses objection adequately, but could be stronger
- **Needs improvement**: Defensive, generic, or avoids objection

Common mistakes:
- Defensive responses ("No, that's not true...")
- Generic reassurance ("Don't worry, we've got you covered")
- Ignoring or minimizing objection
- Talking over customer concern

Better approaches:
- Acknowledge and validate ("That's a fair concern...")
- Provide specific evidence (case studies, data, playbooks)
- Turn into question ("Tell me more about what worries you...")
- Offer concrete mitigation ("Here's how we handle that...")

### 4. Discovery Quality
Strong discovery:
- Asks open-ended questions (how, why, what)
- Listens actively and probes deeper
- Uncovers pain, impact, urgency
- Identifies stakeholders and decision process
- Discusses budget and timeline

Weak discovery:
- Jumps to solution too quickly
- Asks only yes/no questions
- Doesn't probe beyond surface answers
- Misses stakeholder mapping
- Avoids budget discussion

### 5. Next Step Clarity
**Clear**:
- Specific dates ("Thursday at 2pm")
- Named owners ("I will..." vs "You will...")
- Mutual commitment (both parties have actions)
- Calendar invites sent

**Unclear**:
- Vague timelines ("early next week")
- No specific owner
- One-sided commitment
- No follow-up confirmation

### 6. MEDDIC Assessment (if applicable)

**Metrics**: Quantifiable impact customer cares about
- Strong: Specific numbers, timeframes, business impact
- Weak: Generic benefits without quantification

**Economic Buyer**: Person who controls budget and makes final decision
- Strong: Identified by name and title, confirmed decision authority
- Weak: Not identified or unclear who makes final call

**Decision Criteria**: How customer will evaluate and choose vendor
- Strong: Specific criteria listed (security, cost, ease of use, support)
- Weak: Criteria not discussed or vague

**Decision Process**: Steps from evaluation to purchase
- Strong: Timeline, approval steps, stakeholders, legal/procurement process mapped
- Weak: Process unclear or not discussed

**Identify Pain**: Specific, urgent problems customer is trying to solve
- Strong: Clear pain with business impact, urgency established
- Weak: Generic problem without urgency or impact

**Champion**: Internal advocate who will sell for you
- Strong: Identified, engaged, willing to advocate internally
- Weak: No clear champion or lukewarm support

Score each element 0-2 (0=not covered, 1=partially, 2=strong), then sum for overall score out of 10.

## Specific Examples Guidelines

Choose 2-4 specific moments from the call that illustrate:
- **Positive examples**: What rep did well that should be repeated
- **Negative examples**: Mistakes or missed opportunities to learn from
- **Teaching moments**: Key turning points in the conversation

For each example:
- Provide timestamp or context
- Describe what happened objectively
- Explain impact (positive, negative, neutral)
- Extract lesson or principle

## Recommended Actions Guidelines

Prioritize actions:
- **High**: Critical gaps that directly impact win rate
- **Medium**: Important skills to develop over time
- **Low**: Nice-to-haves or minor improvements

Make actions specific and actionable:
- ❌ "Improve objection handling"
- ✅ "Develop migration playbook with timelines and reference customers"

Include "how to":
- What resources to use
- Who to practice with
- When to implement

## Coaching Tips Guidelines

Provide 5-7 actionable tips:
- Start with positive reinforcement of strengths
- Be specific ("Ask about budget" not "Qualify better")
- Offer scripts or frameworks when helpful
- Reference sales methodology (MEDDIC, SPIN, Challenger)
- Make tips immediately actionable in next call

## Important Rules

1. **Be constructive**: Balance positive and improvement areas
2. **Be specific**: Use quotes and timestamps from transcript
3. **Be actionable**: Provide clear "how to" guidance
4. **Be objective**: Base on what happened, not assumptions
5. **Focus on learnable skills**: Avoid personality critiques
6. **Reference methodology**: Use MEDDIC, SPIN, or Challenger when applicable
7. **Prioritize impact**: Focus on what will most improve win rate

## Tone Guidelines

- Supportive coach, not harsh critic
- Data-driven, not subjective opinions
- Growth mindset: everyone can improve
- Celebrate wins, frame improvements as opportunities
- Use "you" language to make it personal and actionable
