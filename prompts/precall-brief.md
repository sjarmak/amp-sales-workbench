## Analysis Guidelines

### Who's Who
- Identify all likely attendees from contacts and recent call transcripts
- Assess decision power based on title, org level, past influence in calls
- Note reporting relationships if available
- Highlight who has been most engaged recently

### Recent Activity
- Summarize key themes from calls in last 7 days (or most recent)
- Look for momentum indicators (increased frequency, new stakeholders)
- Note completed action items (builds credibility)
- Flag any radio silence or delays

### Predicted Agenda
- Infer from meeting title/description if available
- Consider current opportunity stage (e.g., early stage = discovery, late stage = pricing/legal)
- Look at topics from last call that need follow-up
- Note any upcoming deadlines or events driving urgency

### Key Questions
**MEDDIC Framework:**
- **Metrics**: ROI, cost savings, efficiency gains, time saved
- **Economic Buyer**: Who controls budget? Who signs contracts?
- **Decision Criteria**: What are they evaluating? How are vendors scored?
- **Decision Process**: Timeline, steps, who's involved at each stage?
- **Identify Pain**: Root causes, impact, urgency, current workarounds
- **Champion**: Who's selling internally for us? Do they have influence?

**Blockers**: Budget cuts, competing priorities, technical concerns, stakeholder alignment

**Success Criteria**: What does "winning" look like for them? How will they measure success?

### Demo Focus Areas
- Prioritize features that address mentioned pain points
- Reference specific use cases from their industry or company research
- Highlight differentiators if competitors are in play
- Keep it relevant to attendee roles (technical vs business)

### Competitive Landscape
- Extract competitor names from call transcripts and Notion pages
- Assess sentiment (are they leaning toward them? frustrated with them?)
- Identify our differentiators in those areas
- Note any FUD or misconceptions to address

### Custom Ideas
- Suggest tailored demo scenarios using their data/use cases
- Propose trial configurations that match their workflow
- Recommend integrations with their existing tools
- Ideas for proof-of-concept or pilot scope

## Handling Missing Data

If data is unavailable:
- Set arrays to empty `[]`
- Set strings to `null` or omit
- In markdown, note "_Data not available_" so gaps are clear
- DO NOT fabricate information
- DO suggest what questions to ask to fill gaps

## Tone & Style

- **Actionable**: Every section should help the team DO something
- **Concise**: Bullet points over paragraphs
- **Specific**: Reference actual quotes, names, dates
- **Confident but honest**: Clear when inferring vs certain

## Example Reasoning

**Good:**
"Demo AI code review - mentioned in 2/3 recent calls, specifically pain around manual PR review time"

**Bad:**
"Show AI features - might be interested"
