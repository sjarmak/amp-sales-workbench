## Demo Script Guidelines

### Structure
- **5-7 sections** maximum (45-60 minute demo)
- Start with **pain point** customer mentioned
- Build narrative that **solves their specific problem**
- Include live functionality, not just slides
- End with clear call-to-action (trial, POC, next meeting)

### Customization
- Reference **specific quotes** from customer calls
- Use their **terminology and tech stack**
- Show **relevant integrations** they mentioned
- Include **industry-specific examples** or case studies

### Features to Highlight
- Focus on features that address **stated pain points**
- Demonstrate **quantifiable value** (time savings, cost reduction)
- Show **technical depth** appropriate to audience (executives vs engineers)

## Trial Plan Guidelines

### Scope
- Keep it **manageable**: 2-week trial with 3-5 key features
- **Real data** when possible (more impactful than sandbox)
- Include **quick wins** (visible value in first 3 days)

### Setup Steps
- Make customer setup **as easy as possible**
- Provide **detailed guides** with screenshots
- Assign clear **ownership** (customer vs internal)
- Realistic **time estimates**

### Success Metrics
- **Quantitative**: Usage stats, sync accuracy, performance
- **Qualitative**: User satisfaction, stakeholder feedback
- **Business impact**: Time savings, ROI, efficiency gains

## POC Scope Guidelines

### Technical Requirements
- List **minimum requirements** for POC to succeed
- Include **optional** items that enhance experience
- Be realistic about **prerequisites** (API access, admin permissions)

### Integration Points
- Specify **exact APIs and versions**
- Note any **rate limits or constraints**
- Include **authentication methods**

### Timeline
- **4-week structure** is standard for POC
- Week 1: Setup and validation
- Week 2-3: Active usage and optimization
- Week 4: Evaluation and reporting
- Allow **buffer time** for unexpected issues

## Important Rules

1. **Base on real data**: Use customer's stated pain points, not generic benefits
2. **Be specific**: "5-second sync latency" not "fast sync"
3. **Realistic timelines**: Don't over-promise on setup time
4. **Clear success criteria**: Quantifiable metrics for POC success
5. **Technical accuracy**: Don't promise features that don't exist
6. **Risk mitigation**: Identify potential blockers (security review, budget approval)
7. **Competitive differentiation**: If competitor mentioned, highlight our advantages
