## Analysis Guidelines

### 1. Next Steps
- Extract **specific, actionable** next steps from the call
- Include **owner** (AE, Customer, Solutions Engineer, etc.)
- Make them **time-bound** when possible
- Prioritize by urgency and impact

### 2. Blockers & Risks
- Identify **explicit blockers** mentioned (budget approval, legal review, etc.)
- Detect **implicit risks** (hesitation, uncertain timelines, competitive pressure)
- Note **dependencies** that could delay progress

### 3. Stage Progression Signals
- Determine if opportunity should move to a different stage
- Look for **buying signals**: budget confirmed, timeline set, technical validation, champion engaged
- Provide **clear reasoning** for stage change recommendations

### 4. Success Criteria
- Extract **customer-stated** success metrics
- Include **quantitative targets** when mentioned (user count, timeline, ROI)
- Note **qualitative goals** (integration requirements, performance expectations)

### 5. Feature Requests
- List **specific features** or capabilities requested
- Include **context** if important (why they need it, priority level)
- Note if requests are **must-haves vs nice-to-haves**

### 6. Stakeholder Sentiment
- Assess **overall sentiment**: positive, neutral, negative
- Break down **by stakeholder** if multiple people were on call
- Base on: tone, enthusiasm level, objections raised, questions asked

### 7. Suggested Close Date
- Only suggest if **timeline mentioned** in call
- Base on: customer deadlines, budget cycles, start date targets
- Include **confidence level** based on how explicit the timeline was

## Task Generation Guidelines

### Task Types
- **follow-up**: Action items for the AE to do
- **internal**: Work for internal teams (SE, Legal, Product)
- **customer-action**: Things customer needs to do

### Due Dates
- Default to **2 days** for urgent follow-ups
- Use **before next scheduled meeting** if one was mentioned
- For customer actions, suggest reasonable timelines based on complexity

### Priorities
- **high**: Critical path items, customer is waiting
- **medium**: Important but not blocking
- **low**: Nice to have, can be done later

## Follow-up Email Guidelines

### Structure
1. **Thank you** and meeting recap
2. **Key discussion points** (brief bullets)
3. **Action items** with owners and dates
4. **Timeline** for next milestones
5. **Call to action** (what you need from them)

### Tone
- Professional but warm
- Clear and concise
- Action-oriented
- Collaborative ("we" language)

### Recipients
- **To**: Primary stakeholders who were on the call
- **CC**: Internal team members who need visibility

## Coaching Feedback Guidelines

Analyze the AE's call performance and provide constructive coaching in three areas:

### What Went Well
- Identify **specific techniques** that were effective
- Highlight **strong discovery questions** or rapport building
- Note successful **objection handling** or value articulation
- Recognize moments where the AE **advanced the sale**

### Areas for Improvement
- Point out **missed opportunities** (questions not asked, objections not addressed)
- Identify **technique gaps** (MEDDIC elements not covered, champion not identified)
- Note **communication issues** (talking too much, not active listening)
- Suggest **better approaches** for specific moments in the call

### Suggested Next Steps
- Recommend **specific training** or frameworks to study (MEDDIC, SPIN, Challenger)
- Suggest **preparation activities** for next calls (research, scripts, objection handling)
- Provide **actionable coaching points** to practice

**Tone**: Constructive and supportive, focused on growth. Always start with positives.

## Salesforce Field Recommendations

Provide **field-level** recommendations for updates to Salesforce objects based on the call. Each recommendation should:

### Structure
- **objectType**: Opportunity, Account, Contact, or Task
- **recordId**: Salesforce ID if known (from current SF state)
- **field**: API name of the field (e.g., "Next_Step__c", "StageName", "CloseDate")
- **currentValue**: What's currently in SF (from SF state provided)
- **recommendedValue**: What it should be updated to
- **reasoning**: Why this change is recommended (reference specific call moments)
- **confidence**: high/medium/low based on how explicit the information was in the call

### Common Fields to Update

**Opportunity Fields:**
- `StageName`: Only recommend if clear buying signals justify stage progression
- `Next_Step__c`: Immediate next action item
- `CloseDate`: If timeline was discussed
- `Feedback_Trends__c`: Customer sentiment and feedback
- `Success_Criteria__c`: Customer-stated success metrics
- `Feature_Requests__c`: Specific capabilities requested
- `Path_To_Close__c`: Step-by-step close plan
- `Likelihood_To_Close__c`: Probability assessment

**Contact Fields:**
- `Title`: If title mentioned differs from SF
- `Department`: If learned in call
- `Role`: (Champion, Blocker, Influencer, Decision Maker)

**Account Fields:**
- Update if new information learned about company

### Guidelines
1. **Only recommend updates for fields that actually need changing** based on new information from the call
2. **Always include currentValue** so user can verify the change makes sense
3. **Be specific in reasoning** - reference what was said in the call
4. **Don't recommend speculative updates** - only suggest changes based on explicit information

## CRM Patch Format

Follow the same YAML format as the draft-patches.md prompt:

### Key Opportunity Fields to Update
- **Next_Step__c**: Immediate next action
- **Feedback_Trends__c**: Customer sentiment and feedback summary
- **Success_Criteria__c**: Customer's definition of success
- **Feature_Requests__c**: List of requested capabilities
- **Path_To_Close__c**: Step-by-step plan to close
- **Likelihood_To_Close__c**: Probability assessment
- **CloseDate**: Expected close date
- **Description**: Overall opportunity context

### Confidence Levels
- **high**: Explicitly stated in call, multiple confirmations
- **medium**: Implied or single mention
- **low**: Speculative based on limited information

## Important Rules

1. **Be specific**: "Send pricing proposal" not "Follow up on pricing"
2. **Include context**: Reference what was discussed in the call
3. **Time-bound everything**: Every task and action item needs a date
4. **Extract verbatim when possible**: Use customer's exact words for success criteria
5. **Don't over-promise**: Only suggest stage changes if clear signals exist
6. **Preserve existing data**: Use "before" field to show current state
7. **Source everything**: Always attribute to "gong" for call-derived insights

## Example: Minimal Update (Short Call)

For a brief check-in call with no major updates:

```json

  "analysis": {
    "nextSteps": ["Schedule follow-up for Q4 budget discussion"],
    "blockers": [],
    "successCriteriaMentioned": [],
    "featureRequests": [],
    "stakeholderSentiment": { "overall": "neutral" }
  },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "Schedule Q4 budget discussion",
      "description": "Customer wants to reconnect in 2 weeks once budget is finalized",
      "dueDate": "2024-11-01",
      "type": "follow-up",
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  ],
  "followUpEmail": {
    "to": ["contact@customer.com"],
    "subject": "Follow-up: Q4 budget discussion",
    "body": "Hi [Name],\n\nThanks for the quick sync today. As discussed, I'll reach out in 2 weeks once your Q4 budget is finalized.\n\nLooking forward to continuing the conversation!\n\nBest,\n[Your name]"
  },
  "crmPatch": {
    "accountKey": {...},
    "generatedAt": "2024-10-20T15:30:00Z",
    "approved": false
  }
}
```

Your output must be valid JSON that can be parsed programmatically.
