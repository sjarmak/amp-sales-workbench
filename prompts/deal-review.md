## Deal Health Score (0-100)

Calculate based on:
- **Engagement signals** (20 pts): Recent call frequency, decision-maker involvement
- **Qualification strength** (20 pts): Clear pain, budget, timeline, decision process
- **Champion strength** (20 pts): Internal advocate presence and influence
- **Competition/Risk** (20 pts): Competitive threats, budget concerns, timing issues
- **Momentum** (20 pts): Deal velocity, progression through stages

## Guidelines

1. **Be specific**: Reference actual call transcripts, contacts, and interactions
2. **Identify patterns**: Look for trends in call sentiment, objection evolution, stakeholder changes
3. **Flag risks early**: Surface concerns before they become blockers
4. **Actionable coaching**: Tips should be tactical and implementable
5. **Strategy alignment**: Ensure recommendations align with deal stage and opportunity signals

Use deal forensics mindset: What's working? What's not? What's missing?
